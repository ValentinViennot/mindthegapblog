<!-- TODO: review text -->
We are excited to share our insights, experiences, and ideas with you on a wide range of topics, including technology, design, and society. Our goal is to contribute to individual and collective intelligence, and to inspire and challenge our readers to think critically and consider different perspectives.

In this first blog entry, we want to introduce ourselves and share a little bit about our background and goals. As a driven and ambitious inventor, engineer, and product manager, I am passionate about using technology to make the world a better place. Growing up, I was always trying to solve problems with my ideas and inventions, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in Communication Systems and Computer Science at INSA Lyon.

One of my first experiences with the internet was as a teenager, when I didn't have access to the internet at home. I was determined to connect to the internet, so I tried to remember and copy the IP and DNS configuration from the computers at school. Needless to say, my attempt was not successful! But looking back, I'm glad I didn't have access to the internet too early, as it gave me a lot of time to be bored and to engage in low dopamine level activities, which I believe has contributed to my creativity and thought-challenging abilities.

But finally, here I am. Writing to the world, on the (real) internet! In addition to sharing our experiences and insights, we also have a few surprises in store for our readers. Keep an eye out for our hidden Easter egg, which will challenge and inspire you as you explore our blog. And be sure to check out our upcoming blog entries on creating habits and a healthy life schedule, the benefits of open source, and the potential of individual and collective intelligence.

Thank you for visiting "Mind the gap blog"! We look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.

Sincerely, Valentin.
