In [Open Source is not profitable](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Open%20Source%20is%20not%20profitable), I explain my thinking that —in a Capitalist Economy—, Open Source has no (financial) added value.

What this means is that, when the added _Value_ is _measured with_ the valuation of the total financial assets created or gathered by a company, then Open Source projects and companies deliver an added value close to Zero (or at least, not as fast growing as traditional companies relying on proprietary assets).

However, when the added _Value_ is measured with the amount of "good" Innovation or Progress added to society, then it should be trivial that [Open Source has the biggest added value](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Open%20Source%20has%20the%20biggest%20added%20value).

I therefore conclude that "the market is broken". In the sense that (_in my opinion_) it's not doing its valuation job properly.

![Meme 'You had one job'](./you-had-one-job34-580x425.jpg)

Open Source is not profitable.

But, **why is that?** why is the market broken? , and how exactly? , and how to fix it?

_Disclaimer: I never studied the fields of Economy and Finance. Forgive my simplifications and naive assumptions. Don't make any decision based on my notes._

## The Creation of Value

In our current —Capitalist— Economy (read The Real World), **Intellectual Property (IP) and Human Labour are seen just the same as other Production Means.**

They can be traded and used (=exploited) to create value. But _they aren't value_.

**Labour and IP aren't free**: They are constrained _in order to_ produce _Value_. Same as for Natural Resources. They are all just **means to an end** (Profit).

_Value_ is what comes _out_ of the profitable use of all these various resources.

A (convenient) corollary is that **Capital is only measured as an amount of Money.**

> _Wait , didn't you just conclude that Open Source is **super** profitable?_ Indeed. If you manage to have Open Source developers contribute for free to your project (or that you only use freely available software to enable your business)... then your business' added value just increased as your reduced the cost of resources. End users don't (have to) care that your code is freely available. For most of them, what they (only) care about is your end product. So why does it not work like this? ... Because of competition.

### The Curse of Competition

**The competitive market is designed to optimise the use of resources.**

If you open sourced your business critical software (IP) with a true Open Source Licence (ie granting [See, Edit, and Share](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Open%20Source%20should%20always%20be%20Free) rights), then your competitors would be able to simply copy your core value and start competing with you for a $0 entry cost.

Eventually, your only way to make more money (profit) than your competitors —ie to add more _value_— would be to minimise your use of resources. At the end, with enough competition, your customers (market consumers) should be able to pay for exactly what was the production cost of what you are selling (in = out).

This is a —sort of— ideal market. At least, from a short-term consumer perspective.

But optimising resources also means compromising on the cost of Labour and IP. With unregulated (or not-enough-regulated) competition, this leads to poorly paid workers and unbearable working conditions. And/or to really bad products.

In the end, it also means no more investment in IP —ie, no more Innovation. **Without added value, there's no investment feedback loop**. One can still invest their money, but it would be based on good will and for a low ROI.

In fact, for your hypothetical company that just decided to open source its business critical software, it gets even worse than what I just wrote above.

Because you initially invested Capital (=money) in the Labour (=employees' work/time) that went into creating your business critical software, you are now **loosing** money. Your competitors on the other hand could enter the game at no cost.

**As a consequence , an open sourcing strategy would lead to your company going bankrupt (or almost bankrupt) and leaving behind a commoditised market.**

### A note on Corporations abusing Open Source contributors

There are a few open sourcing strategies that don't end with your company facing bankruptcy.

However, most of them are not **true** Open Source. In fact, most of them are just tricking Open Source contributors into doing free work for the benefit of a for-profit company.

Mostly, we distinguish ([The Open Source business models](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/The%20Open%20Source%20business%20models)):

1. Open Core: the Hybrid model.
2. Consulting Services: the Red Hat model.
3. Brand value: the Ubuntu model.
4. Disruption Tool: the Google model.
5. Bivalent Licence: the Meta model.

Open Core is an insult to the Open Source ideology, it's like a honey pot tricking users and contributors into your ecosystem. But then the value-adding features are close source. The worse kind is Close Core (Backend) Open Client (Frontend). Then you really are just exploiting free work for your own benefit.

Consulting Services are a very smart and functional business model. It worked well for Red Hat for some time. The only (non-negligible) downside is that it doesn't scale. It requires 1:1 hiring and therefore profits can't compete with closed-source solutions.

[Brand value](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Brand%20value) is an interesting one. It's basically implying that your copy (fork) of "Ubuntu" is worth nothing if you cannot name it "Ubuntu". Brand valuation has three main downsides:

1. It takes time and resources to build
2. It's hard to quantify
3. And it's worth nothing if you can't _leverage_ it (ie sell your products at a higher price)

Using Open Source as a Disruption Tool is also a very interesting one. Google used this strategy at least twice with Android and then Kubernetes in order to disrupt markets where they were not the #1 (and therefore, losing: [There's only one winner](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/There's%20only%20one%20winner)). It's not _per-say_ generating profits, but it's a good strategy to get there. It's also not _per-say_ directly abusing Open Source contributors, but it's still (arguably) persuading workers to do free labour for an end that is essentially of benefit to you as a for-profit economic agent.

Finally, the Bivalent License is a new model (~2023) popularised by Meta with their open-source LLM "LLaMa2". The strategy consists of using a conditional Licence. If you're a free rider but not making a profit, you can keep using it for free. However, if you start being profitable thanks to the use of the open-sourced asset, then you fall into the proprietary part of the Licence and have to seek a commercial agreement.

**Successful Open Source companies today are a combination of multiple of these commercialisation strategies.**

However, Open Core and Bivalent License aren't true Open Source ([Open Source should always be Free](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Open%20Source%20should%20always%20be%20Free)). Consulting Services and Brand Value are great strategies but are really hard to leverage and scale. And finally, the Disruption Tool strategy is smart but doesn't serve an immediately leverage-able end.

## Open Source can't create Value in a Capitalist Economy

_*Open Source can't create Value in a **traditional** Capitalist Economy_

By definition, the Open Source ideology makes the strong axioms that both Labour and Intellectual Property must be free ([Open Source should always be Free](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Open%20Source%20should%20always%20be%20Free)).

This is frontally opposed to the Capitalist axioms mentioned above.

**Therefore, Open Source and Capitalism are incompatible.**

These principles, or rather Axioms, are like the Laws of Physics of a Capitalist Economy and of Open Source. One one side, that's how Investors can make a Profit thanks to their Capital. On the other side, that's why Open Source contributors are willing to work.

> Ok, so, we're stuck. This is an unsolvable problem. ... [Tell me it's impossible and I'll do it](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Tell%20me%20it's%20impossible%20and%20I'll%20do%20it)

## Redefining Capital

All these thoughts and ideas occupied my mind for quite some time. And I really couldn't understand how to make sense of them and find a solution. Or at least one that didn't involve global, coordinated, marxist-style regulations.

Until I read the vision statement of [DeSo](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/DeSo).

What they were building there at [DeSo](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/DeSo) was a decentralised social network leveraging "Influence" (ie, some kind of [Brand value](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Brand%20value)) effectively as _Capital_. You could now invest your Influence, trade someone else's Influence, and bet on someone's —or your own— future Influence.

In parallel, the fact that cryptos markets (DeFi) were able to (at least temporarily) move the traditional Global Economy (TradFi) was a Proof of Concept that building a new, decentralised, "web3"-style Economy could transform the Global System ([interesting read on DeFi vs TradFi regulations](https://anplanger.medium.com/the-threat-to-defi-is-not-regulation-4a2cf87d8f9a)).

### Money, Time, and Influence as Capital (= Value)

([All we do is invest](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/all-we-do-is-investment/) —[source](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/blog%2Fposts%2Finvesting-time%2Findex))

If we start looking at Time (=work) as Capital instead of a production mean, we have a shot at solving the unsolvable.

**Capital is free.** It belongs to everyone. The question is "who is able to leverage it, and who isn't?".

#### Socialism

In a very Capitalist Economy/World, only a few lucky ones are... and it's full of vicious circles/feedback loops ([At the end of a Monopoly game, there can only be one winner](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/At%20the%20end%20of%20a%20Monopoly%20game%2C%20there%20can%20only%20be%20one%20winner)).

In the Socialist ideology, Labour=Value ([Human Labour is what creates Value](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Human%20Labour%20is%20what%20creates%20Value)). And ultimately , Capital should be redistributed so that everyone gets a chance to leverage it. In practice, Socialism in a Capitalist Economy has very limited options.

## The New Open Economy

So how can we effectively solve the unsolvable?

The only thing we need to do is **to create a new Economy that sets Time (=Work), Money, and Influence (=Brand) as equivalent parameters of Value creation**. This New Economy (read New World) would require projects to be Open Source, for fairness.

The equation of such System could be: `Brand(t) = Time(t) x Money(t)`.

Project Contributors (Leadership, Workers and Investors/Consumers) would then compete in order to build the most valuable Brand on the market. They would do so by defining a governance, culture, making decisions and investments in order to create an identity (the Brand) that is the best at serving their consumers (=users).

### The Gift of Open Competition

Open Competition (= all projects must be Open Source) would guarantee the most fair, most innovative, most _profitable_ (for society) race ([Open innovation is the healthiest competition](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/Open%20innovation%20is%20the%20healthiest%20competition)).

This New Economy only addresses and solves the Innovation market. The traditional market (TradFi) would still need to co-exist in order to support resource-centric businesses and other consulting (Partner-type of) businesses.

> A change in ideology would ideally mean that workers would eventually collaboratively own factories as they aren't profitable to former Investors anymore. Only freed Human Labour would then be able to get used to create Value.

Eventually, the only resources left to optimise in the traditional economy would be natural resources (energy, materials...) and commoditised labour (=that would eventually get replaced with robots).

**As a consequence, this New Economy would effectively leverage the Traditional Economy in order to optimise the use of natural resources and maximise Innovation.**

### Disrupting the Capitalist Economy

In this New Economy, Profit will still be possible. It would however now mostly happen on the side of the New, Open Economy as traditional resource-centric businesses get commoditised.

In addition, some Profit would still be possible within the traditional economy. Human Labour being the only irreplaceable Value. Profitable businesses with differentiated competitive value coming from non-commoditised Human Labour would still exist. For example, Partner-type businesses: Lawyer firms, Investment Funds and Asset Management, Restaurants, etc.

**In the end, Added Value would come exclusively from human creativity.**

[The Open Market](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/The%20Open%20Market) aims to make this New Economy a reality.

> Eventually, Humans as freed workers would educate more and more in order to collectively keep creating Value (ie, be more creative and skilled workers) , therefore achieving: [My mission](https://notes.valentin.viennot.me/My%20mission).
