      <title>Common tragedies: Funding open source vs Saving the planet</title>

      <description>In my last post —Why Open Source isn&amp;rsquo;t Profitable—, I explain the Curse of Competition as a sort of Tragedy of the Commons: because open-source intellectual property is free to access, all economic agents will exploit it without giving back (a.k.a. as the free riders issue). If the resource is finite, then its value will tragically be destroyed by this unrestrained consumption.
With the same analysis, we can explain how and why our current dominant economic system will eventually consume all of the available natural resources and destroy all living species.</description>

      <description>In Open Source is not profitable, I explain my thinking that —in a Capitalist Economy—, Open Source has no (financial) added value.
What this means is that, when the added Value is measured with the valuation of the total financial assets created or gathered by a company, then Open Source projects and companies deliver an added value close to Zero (or at least, not as fast growing as traditional companies relying on proprietary assets).</description>

      <description>Leaving this here for posterity:
&amp;ldquo;Dying isn&amp;rsquo;t as sad as Not living.&amp;rdquo;
—Valentin Viennot, 2023
I know; death is a sad and probably not the most exciting topic for a post. But you needed to read it. In fact, this post is more about life than death. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a wake-up call, an invitation even.
I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer that our life choices are investments that shape the value and meaning we extract from life itself.</description>

      <title>All we do is invest.</title>

      <description>All we are doing is investment. Taking the bus to meet a friend? That&amp;rsquo;s an investment. Quitting your job to work at another company? That&amp;rsquo;s investing. Skipping the gym? Bad investment, but still one. Going to bed early? Probably a good investment. So let me give you my best investment advice: spend your time wisely. Imagine you are a millionaire and you are placing your entire fortune into 24 chunks of money every day.</description>
