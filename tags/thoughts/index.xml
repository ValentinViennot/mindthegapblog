      <description>Leaving this here for posterity: &amp;ldquo;Dying isn&amp;rsquo;t as sad as Not living.&amp;rdquo; —Valentin Viennot, 2023
I know; death is a sad and probably not the most exciting topic for a post. But you needed to read it. In fact, this post is more about life than death. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a wake-up call, an invitation even.
I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer that our life choices are investments that shape the value and meaning we extract from life itself.</description>

      <description>All we are doing is investment. Taking the bus to meet a friend? That&amp;rsquo;s an investment. Quitting your job to work at another company? That&amp;rsquo;s investing. Skipping the gym? Bad investment, but still one. Going to bed early? Probably a good investment. So let me give you my best investment advice: spend your time wisely. Imagine you are a millionaire and you are placing your entire fortune into 24 chunks of money every day.</description>
