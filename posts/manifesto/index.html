We are workers, peasants, and peoples of the world. We are entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, thinkers, researchers, users, builders, investors. We are socially conscious individuals.\nWe are believers in the greatest good for the greatest number, measuring value not just in financial profits but in positive societal impact.\nWe are advocates for our personal freedom and autonomy in the digital era, defending our right to innovate and share without constraints.\nWe are supporters of a collective approach to innovation, where resources and knowledge are shared for the common good.\nWe are upholding the principles of democracy, encouraging active participation and equal representation in the innovation process.\nWe are empowering transformative open technology to solve the most pressing challenges of our time. We only believe in the open, decentralized, and equitable kind of innovation.\nWe are committed to continuous progress, always pushing the boundaries of technology to drive positive change. Yet, we assert that growth does not equal progress.\nWe are determined.\nOur mission is to free innovation.\nDemocratizing access to technology and finance.\nWe are responsible techno-optimists, we are Human-centric progressivists. We believe in progress, but not just any progress. Ours is a vision where human well-being, equity, and environmental sustainability form the core of technological advancements.\nDemocratic social technologists. Technology should not be a tool for profit, but a means to empower communities, uphold democratic values, and foster social cohesion. Technology should erase inequalities, not increase them.\nEthical innovation advocates. Every technological stride must be measured not just by its brilliance or profitability, but by its ethical implications and impact on society at large. We recognize our society’s and planet’s fragility and advocate for innovations that not only respect but actively heal our natural world and better our societies.\nInclusive visionaries. Our future is one where diversity is not just accepted but celebrated, where every voice finds a place in shaping our shared destiny. We embrace all identities and leverage the strength of community in empowering them.\nWe value openness, collaboration, freedom Freedom. Free workers. Free users. Free knowledge. Free innovation. Free markets.\nOpenness. Open source. Open science. Open governance. Open communities.\nCollaborative meritocracy. Working together is more democratic than voting.\nDecentralization. Nothing justifies centralization where decentralization is possible.\nWe believe in Humanist techno-optimism. Technology is a potential force for good, but its value lies in serving humanity, not overshadowing it. Our optimism is grounded in the potential of technology to enhance life without compromising human values.\nCollective empowerment over individualism. The best of innovation is reached not in isolation but in collaboration, where shared goals triumph over individual agendas.\nUncapped progress, capped growth. Economic prosperity and technological advancements should not come at the expense of our planet or future generations.\nWe oppose Blind market dogmatism. Markets are tools, not worshipped deities. They should serve society, not dictate its course. Monetary value is nothing more than a mere exchange of human labor.\nUnregulated tech monopolies. Concentrated power in the hands of a few giants destroys innovation and equity.\nTechnology without conscience. Innovation devoid of ethical consideration is a path to societal decay.\nEnvironmental negligence. Ignoring the ecological impact of technological progress is unacceptable.\nThe only kind of abundance we can accept is one for all species.\nRedefining value creation through open innovation We aim to redefine value creation.\nWe prioritize collective innovation and societal impact over private profits.\nWe stand for an open, decentralized, collaborative economy.\nWe are committed to building the future of Work.\n1. Redefining the economic system We no longer believe in the current economic system.\nOur ‘capitalist’ economy has led to an undemocratic world dictated by finance and controlled by tech monopolies, at the expense of human values.\nWe are modern serfs, sweating our dignity in exchange for digital dopamine shots. We are trapped in a consumerist illusion, acting as powerless users or buyers. We are passively watching our own extinction, made to believe there’s nothing we can do. We are ironically hoping for random tech ‘geniuses’ billionaires to save us.\n“It’s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.”\nOur short-term profits-led economic system has created irreconcilable issues that turned into global challenges: climate change, loss of biodiversity, depletion of Earth’s resources, wealth and wage inequalities, political polarisation. And we—the workers and younger generations—want to end this system that we did not create. We understand that we won’t overcome these challenges without a drastic change in the way society operates.\nWhether ‘Capitalism’ is the problem or not is irrelevant (in fact, Capitalism might have already been replaced with a form of Techno-feudalism, exploiting attention and platform rents, and it is far worse).\nOur current economic system is broken and it is our duty to fix it.\nWe, workers and consumers, hold the power.\nMoney is worth nothing if we don’t play by the established rules. Our human labor and intellectual contributions have value beyond monetary measures.\nWe resist alienation. We resist capital accumulation.\nWe want to contribute great, meaningful work.\nThe meaning of life. Why do we work? We work because we are humans.\nWe work to give meaning to our lives. We work to consciously, intentionally shape our surroundings. We work as a socially organized way to expand.\nIndividual motives might differ (search for meaning, mission, survival…), but, collectively, our work serves a society-level accomplishment.\nWe work to create value.\nValue is a flowing abstract matter, it’s an exchange of power. Capital, on the other hand, is an accumulation of power.\nValue ‘creation’ is trading one good for another, money for service, wage for skilled time. The amount of value ‘created’ conceptually equals the underlying utility of the trade. And utility is defined socially—by us—: through markets, political structures, communities.\nWe defend our human right to solely work for goals and missions we believe in.\nValue vs. Price Value is what we want it to be.\nValue is all around us. Value is theoretical, highly-subjective, latent, speculative and immeasurable. “Value is in the eye of the beholder.”\nValue cannot be created. Value can be traded, actioned, and amplified.\nPrice is what we pay to access traded value.\nPrice is the instantaneous exchange value.\nIn theory, free markets should ensure ‘fair’ prices. Meaning that,\nWe all pay the same price for the same good or service, It’s the optimal (i.e. lowest) price we could have paid. And, as utilitarians, we aim for the Pareto optimum: an optimal equilibrium situation where better for one would mean worse for others.\nWe believe in free markets to find the Pareto optimum. Free markets imply that,\nExchanges of value can happen freely (within the boundaries of human rights), Everyone can access and fully comprehend the marketplace, By design, no arbitrage (winning without risk) is possible. Freedom is required to efficiently, democratically value things.\nWe acknowledge that under constraint or influence, value is meaningless. For value to be, we must be able to freely want it to be.\nMoney and False promises Money is nothing more than the promise of an exchange of value.\nThroughout our lives, we all unequally collect ‘valuables’ as capital:\nTime Influence Material and immaterial property Often, we perceive and want to access value in valuables that are not ours. (Maybe to provide for our material needs, comfort, or belonging.)\nIn order to access or obtain said desired valuables, a trade has to happen.\nGenerally, trading valuables for valuables isn’t convenient nor deemed fair. Therefore, money is a convenient proxy-valuable, one we can all price equally: a ‘commodity’.\nMoney was created as a means to an end: value ‘creation’ (or rather value exchange). And indeed, it now is the most universal way to trade value.\nUnfortunately, too often, money has become the end itself.\nWe refuse to let money define collective value We won’t falter in finding alternative ways to exchange our value.\nWe won’t hesitate to refuse exchanging our value for money.\nGrowth is not progress We oppose associating growth and progress.\nWhile they are indeed correlated, we reject any form of causality. Progress can happen without growth and growth without progress.\nProgress is moving forward towards a destination.\nIf this destination isn’t an equitable and sustainable future through open innovation for all, then we don’t want it. We claim the right to disagree with the destination and disengage from the journey.\nWe refuse ill-defined, uninspired, purpose-less growth.\nGrowth is an increase in size. But the size of what?\nGDP? The amount of money in circulation? For whom? Resources used? On a resource-limited planet? The number of species going extinct? What for? … Growth isn’t inherently good or bad. Neither is progress.\nWe deserve a better journey.\nDegrowth and progress We don’t want to work more. We don’t want to consume more. We don’t want to always have more.\nWe want to innovate faster and bigger. We want to invest more in meaningful progress. We want to explore ourselves, our planet, the universe.\nWe want to work less. We want to consume less. We want to have less, but better.\nWe want to live. We want to love. We want to laugh.\n2. The role of open innovation The future of innovation will be open or won’t be.\nOpen innovation is the only way to have healthy competition: one that benefits us all.\nTechnology, techno-optimism, won’t save us. Unless we join forces and cooperate now.\nOur generation is faced with immense, life-or-death challenges. We blame it on the previous generations. We blame it on the system. Yet, the only way forward is together. Collaborative, collective, cooperative.\nFor the sake of survival, we will bypass and confront the defenders of closed innovation.\nIndividualism vs. Collectivism We are individuals. We live first for ourselves, to survive.\nWe are communities. We live to belong to social groups.\nWe are humans. We live to care for others, and be cared for.\nWe believe in agency, in individualism. And yet, we also believe in collectivism.\nThe accomplishments of the free software movement and open source communities out there are testaments to the power of collectivism. And they did it despite the system.\nWe believe that humans are fundamentally good; despite bad events and anecdotes.\nWe celebrate the uniqueness of each individual, their right to think, create, and innovate independently. We recognize and advocate for the inherent power of personal freedom. We think that the diversity of thought and experience that each individual brings is the foundation for meaningful and deep innovation.\nWe acknowledge the incredible potential of collective action, where shared goals and mutual support lead to greater achievements than any individual could accomplish alone. We embrace the concept of community, understanding that togetherness is a source of strength and resilience.\nWe assert that the true essence of innovation lies in the harmony of both individual agency and collective effort.\nWe strive to create spaces where individuality is not lost in the collective, but rather, where it is celebrated and enabled to contribute to the greater good.\nWe believe in a world where individual aspirations and communal goals are not at odds but are used in synergies, driving us towards a more inclusive and sustainable future.\nCompetition vs. Cooperation Competition can be good; when it’s a race that encourages everyone to run faster. Competition can be bad; when the narrow focus on winning turns into fistfights.\nCooperation can be good; when it pools knowledge and resources for shared goals. Cooperation can be bad; when it suppresses individual initiative.\nAs techno-optimists, we too believe in competition. Because we too believe in evolution, and we too believe in life. We too believe in the truth.\nWe too believe rich is better than poor, cheap is better than expensive, and abundant is better than scarce. We too believe in making everyone rich, everything cheap, and everything abundant.\nYet we believe cooperation is a whole part of evolution. In fact, we don’t believe that evolution means letting anyone down.\nWe believe in cooperation because we believe it to be the reason why the human race evolved so far and so big. “Together we go further.”\nOur ability to cooperate, to suppress our primal instincts, is in fact our biggest and most human strength.\nWe are in the age of stories, the age of knowledge, the age of wisdom.\n3. Empowerment through decentralized participation Let’s push the emperors into the ocean Don’t need a goon to flirt with devotion With every hour, our number increases We’ll smash your institutions to pieces\nWe need a transformation One we all can see We need a revolution So long as we stay free\nWelcome to the desecration, baby We’ll build you right up and we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration, baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nFree your sons and unlock your daughters We’ll throw the baby out with the bathwater With every second our anger increases We’re gonna smash your nation to pieces.\nCurating identities Our identities are who we are. Our identities belong to us. Our identities are our values and our value.\nOnly we can curate our identities. Yet, digital platforms took it away from us; and corporate-exploited Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to go even further.\nAs knowledge isn’t scarce anymore, curated knowledge will be. But curated doesn’t mean much in a vacuum or outside of the human eye. Curated only means something because we are alive, conscious, social animals. ‘Curated’ equals (=) identity.\nIdentity curation gives birth to communities. Communities forge identity and amplify value. Communities rightly blur the borders between work, life, and the third place.\nWe won’t let AIs curate our identities. We humans will organize. We will build communities to defend our humanity.\nWe proclaim our humanity.\nResource allocation The process of curation is the one of resource allocation: where is time, money, and influence being spent.\nWe believe resource allocation should be here to empower; never to disable. We believe that the exercise of resource allocation should happen freely.\nPrinciple We claim that knowledge must be freely accessible to all, providing the foundation for informed autonomy and enabling the collective intelligence necessary to address systemic issues and develop collective ambition.\nWe claim the freedom for communities to self-organize, and that societal structures should facilitate serendipitous innovation and resilience, ensuring that every individual has the same opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the collective effort to solve our biggest problems and achieve their own mission.\nJoin the movement\n“The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.” —John Maynard Keynes\n","wordCount":"2634","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://mindthegapblog.com/mindthegap-tmp-picture.png","datePublished":"2024-11-08T22:44:29+02:00","dateModified":"2024-11-08T22:44:29+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Valentin Viennot"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/manifesto/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mind the gap blog: Insights, ideas, and inspiration for the tech-savvy and curious.","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mindthegapblog.com/favicon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mindthegapblog.com/ accesskey=h title="m ind the ga p (Alt + H)">m ind the ga p</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mindthegapblog.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://valentin.viennot.me/ title=Portfolio><span>Portfolio</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Manifesto.

We are trapped in a consumerist illusion, acting as powerless users or buyers.
We are passively watching our own extinction, made to believe there&rsquo;s nothing we can do.
We are ironically hoping for random tech &lsquo;geniuses&rsquo; billionaires to save us.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.&rdquo;</p><p>Our short-term profits-led economic system has created irreconcilable issues that turned into global challenges: climate change, loss of biodiversity, depletion of Earth&rsquo;s resources, wealth and wage inequalities, political polarisation. <strong>And we—the workers and younger generations—want to end this system that we did not create</strong>. We understand that we won&rsquo;t overcome these challenges without a drastic change in the way society operates.</p><p>Whether &lsquo;Capitalism&rsquo; is the problem or not is irrelevant (in fact, Capitalism might have already been replaced with a form of Techno-feudalism, exploiting attention and platform rents, and it is far worse).</p><p>Our current economic system is broken <strong>and <a href=../saving-the-planet/>it is our duty to fix it</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>We, workers and consumers, hold the power.</strong></p><p>Money is worth nothing if we don&rsquo;t play by the established rules.

We work to consciously, intentionally shape our surroundings. We work as a socially organized way to expand.</p><p>Individual motives might differ (search for meaning, mission, survival&mldr;),
but, collectively, our work serves a society-level accomplishment.</p><p>We work to <em>create</em> value.</p><p>Value is a flowing abstract matter, it&rsquo;s an exchange of power.
Capital, on the other hand, is an accumulation of power.</p><p>Value &lsquo;<em>creation</em>&rsquo; is trading one good for another, money for service, wage for skilled time.
The amount of value &lsquo;<em>created</em>&rsquo; conceptually equals the underlying utility of the trade.
And utility is defined socially—<strong>by us</strong>—: through markets, political structures, communities.</p><p><strong>We defend our human right to solely work for goals and missions we believe in.</strong></p><h4 id=value-vs-price>Value vs. Price<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#value-vs-price>#</a></h4><p><strong>Value is what we want it to be.</strong></p><p>Value is all around us. Value is theoretical, highly-subjective, latent, speculative and immeasurable.
<strong>&ldquo;Value is in the eye of the beholder.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Value cannot be <em>created</em>.
Value can be <strong>traded</strong>, <strong>actioned</strong>, and <strong>amplified</strong>.</p><p><strong>Price is what we pay to access traded value.</strong></p><p>Price is the instantaneous exchange value.</p><p>In theory, free markets should ensure &lsquo;fair&rsquo; prices. Meaning that,</p><ol><li>We all pay the same price for the same good or service,</li><li>It&rsquo;s the optimal (i.e. lowest) price we could have paid.</li></ol><p>And, as utilitarians, we aim for the Pareto optimum: an optimal equilibrium situation where better for one would mean worse for others.</p><p>We believe in free markets to find the Pareto optimum. Free markets imply that,</p><ol><li>Exchanges of value can happen freely (within the boundaries of human rights),</li><li>Everyone can access and fully comprehend the marketplace,</li><li>By design, no arbitrage (winning without risk) is possible.</li></ol><p>Freedom is required to efficiently, democratically value things.</p><p>We acknowledge that under constraint or influence, value is meaningless.

(Maybe to provide for our material needs, comfort, or belonging.)</p><p>In order to access or obtain said desired valuables, a <em>trade</em> has to happen.</p><p>Generally, trading valuables for valuables isn&rsquo;t convenient nor deemed fair.
Therefore, money is a convenient proxy-valuable, one we can all price equally: a &lsquo;commodity&rsquo;.</p><p>Money was created as a means to an end: value &lsquo;<em>creation</em>&rsquo; (or rather value exchange).
And indeed, it now is the most universal way to <em>trade</em> value.</p><p>Unfortunately, too often, <strong>money has become the end itself</strong>.</p><h4 id=we-refuse-to-let-money-define-collective-value>We refuse to let money define collective value<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#we-refuse-to-let-money-define-collective-value>#</a></h4><p>We won&rsquo;t falter in finding alternative ways to exchange our value.</p><p><strong>We won&rsquo;t hesitate to refuse exchanging our value for money.</strong></p><h4 id=growth-is-not-progress>Growth is not progress<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#growth-is-not-progress>#</a></h4><p>We oppose associating growth and progress.</p><p>While they are indeed correlated, we reject any form of causality.

We recognize and advocate for the inherent power of personal freedom.
We think that the diversity of thought and experience that each individual brings is the foundation for meaningful and deep innovation.</p><p>We acknowledge the incredible potential of collective action, where shared goals and mutual support lead to greater achievements than any individual could accomplish alone.
We embrace the concept of community, understanding that togetherness is a source of strength and resilience.</p><p>We assert that the true essence of innovation lies in the harmony of both individual agency and collective effort.</p><p>We strive to create spaces where individuality is not lost in the collective, but rather, where it is celebrated and enabled to contribute to the greater good.</p><p>We believe in a world where individual aspirations and communal goals are not at odds but are used in synergies, driving us towards a more inclusive and sustainable future.</p><h4 id=competition-vs-cooperation>Competition vs. Cooperation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#competition-vs-cooperation>#</a></h4><p><strong>Competition can be good;</strong> when it&rsquo;s a race that encourages everyone to run faster.

We too believe in the truth.</p><p>We too believe rich is better than poor, cheap is better than expensive, and abundant is better than scarce. We too believe in making everyone rich, everything cheap, and everything abundant.</p><p>Yet we believe cooperation is a whole part of evolution.
