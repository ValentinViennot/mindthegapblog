&ldquo;Dying isn&rsquo;t as sad as Not living.&rdquo;
—Valentin Viennot, 2023

I know; death is a sad and probably not the most exciting topic for a post. But you needed to read it. In fact, this post is more about life than death. It&rsquo;s more of a wake-up call, an invitation even.
I&rsquo;m a firm believer that our life choices are investments that shape the value and meaning we extract from life itself. Yes, we&rsquo;re all going to die; get over it. But surely, you don&rsquo;t want to leave this world with a life unlived. There&rsquo;s no perfect time to start investing it wisely and bravely."><meta name=author content="Valentin Viennot"><link rel=canonical href=https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/we-all-have-a-mission/><meta name=google-site-verification content="G-RTFFSGBVBC"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.fc220c15db4aef0318bbf30adc45d33d4d7c88deff3238b23eb255afdc472ca6.css integrity="sha256-/CIMFdtK7wMYu/MK3EXTPU18iN7/MjiyPrJVr9xHLKY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://mindthegapblog.com/favicon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://mindthegapblog.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://mindthegapblog.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://mindthegapblog.com/favicon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://mindthegapblog.com/favicon.png><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/we-all-have-a-mission/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-RTFFSGBVBC"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-RTFFSGBVBC")}</script><meta property="og:title" content="Dying isn't as sad as Not living."><meta property="og:description" content="

I’ve got responsibilities!”. And I get that. We all do. But remember, it doesn’t require big changes. Helping your child with their homework or even just taking a moment to breathe —that’s living, assuming you put meaning into it.\nSo, are you living? Why are you doing this thing you’re doing? Or rather, why aren’t you doing what you’re not doing but wish you were?\nLet’s live.
