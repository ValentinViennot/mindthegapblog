[{"content":"Hi everyone!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Valentin, an inventor, engineer, and product manager passionate about using technology to make the world a better place. In this blog, I plan to share my insights, experiences, and ideas on a wide range of topics, including technology, design, and society. My mission is to contribute to individual and collective intelligence, and to inspire and challenge my readers — you — to think critically and consider different perspectives.\nI grew up with a natural curiosity and a desire to solve problems with my ideas and inventions. This eventually led me to pursue a degree in Communication Systems and Computer Science at INSA Lyon. Today, I\u0026rsquo;m working as a Product Manager for Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, where I\u0026rsquo;m contributing to bringing free software to the widest audience.\nOne of my earliest experiences with the Internet was as a teenager, when I actually didn\u0026rsquo;t have network access at home. I was determined to connect to the Internet, so I tried to remember and copy the IP and DNS configuration from the computers at school. Needless to say, my attempt was not successful! But looking back, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to this powerful, unlimited resource too early in my life. It gave me a lot of time to be bored, which I believe has contributed to my creativity and thought-challenging attitude.\nNow, here I am writing to the world on the (real) Internet — this time! In addition to sharing my experiences and insights, I really hope to inspire some of you.\nBe sure to check out my upcoming blog entries on various topics such as using OKRs to create a healthy life schedule, managing your recurring tasks like a Sim, the benefits of open source (and not just in software), the potential of individual and collective intelligence, education\u0026hellip;\nThe format of this blog may evolve over time. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (you can find me at @ValentinViennot) or via email (blog@viennot.me) with any feedback or suggestions.\nThanks for reading, and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to share more with you in the future!\nValentin.\n(DALL-E2 might be good a drawings, but not so much at writing texts.)\n","permalink":"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/welcome-mindthegap-blog/","summary":"Hi everyone!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Valentin, an inventor, engineer, and product manager passionate about using technology to make the world a better place.
