[{"content":" I authored last year a manifesto for the \u0026ldquo;Fuck the VCs\u0026rdquo; project: a platform committed to challenging the status quo of the venture capital industry by creating the first open source investment community.\nThe principles outlined in the manifesto resonate deeply with the broader themes that I explore here on my blog, particularly the ideals and ethics of open source. I truly enjoyed writing the Manifesto and figured its principles extend way further than the FTVCs initiative. It\u0026rsquo;s a call to action for creating a more equitable and sustainable future through collaborative, human-centered innovation. It feels very personal to me and I would read it anytime I am feeling low or need to remember why I do the things I do. I am excited to share it with you all here.\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nWe stand at the crossroads of a digital revolution.\nThe path we choose now will shape the future of humanity.\nWe all have the right to invest in and get returns from technology.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Fuck the VCs\u0026rdquo; movement is blurring the lines between investors, consumers, contributors.\nWe are redefining the economic system with a new investment model.\nDemocratizing technology and finance.\nFreeing innovation.\nWe are building the first open source investment community.\nCreating an equitable and sustainable future through open innovation We are Humans. We are workers, peasants, and peoples of the world. We are entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, thinkers, researchers, users, builders, investors. We are socially conscious individuals.\nWe are believers in the greatest good for the greatest number, measuring value not just in financial profits but in positive societal impact.\nWe are advocates for our personal freedom and autonomy in the digital era, defending our right to innovate and share without constraints.\nWe are supporters of a collective approach to innovation, where resources and knowledge are shared for the common good.\nWe are upholding the principles of democracy, encouraging active participation and equal representation in the innovation process.\nWe are empowering transformative open technology to solve the most pressing challenges of our time. We only believe in the open, decentralized, and equitable kind of innovation.\nWe are committed to continuous progress, always pushing the boundaries of technology to drive positive change. Yet, we assert that growth does not equal progress.\nWe are determined.\nOur mission is to free innovation.\nDemocratizing access to technology and finance.\nWe are responsible techno-optimists, we are Human-centric progressivists. We believe in progress, but not just any progress. Ours is a vision where human well-being, equity, and environmental sustainability form the core of technological advancements.\nDemocratic social technologists. Technology should not be a tool for profit, but a means to empower communities, uphold democratic values, and foster social cohesion. Technology should erase inequalities, not increase them.\nEthical innovation advocates. Every technological stride must be measured not just by its brilliance or profitability, but by its ethical implications and impact on society at large. We recognize our society\u0026rsquo;s and planet\u0026rsquo;s fragility and advocate for innovations that not only respect but actively heal our natural world and better our societies.\nInclusive visionaries. Our future is one where diversity is not just accepted but celebrated, where every voice finds a place in shaping our shared destiny. We embrace all identities and leverage the strength of community in empowering them.\nWe value openness, collaboration, freedom Freedom. Free workers. Free users. Free knowledge. Free innovation. Free markets.\nOpenness. Open source. Open science. Open governance. Open communities.\nCollaborative meritocracy. Working together is more democratic than voting.\nDecentralization. Nothing justifies centralization where decentralization is possible.\nWe believe in Humanist techno-optimism. Technology is a potential force for good, but its value lies in serving humanity, not overshadowing it. Our optimism is grounded in the potential of technology to enhance life without compromising human values.\nCollective empowerment over individualism. The best of innovation is reached not in isolation but in collaboration, where shared goals triumph over individual agendas.\nUncapped progress, capped growth. Economic prosperity and technological advancements should not come at the expense of our planet or future generations.\nWe oppose Blind market dogmatism. Markets are tools, not worshipped deities. They should serve society, not dictate its course. Monetary value is nothing more than a mere exchange of human labor.\nUnregulated tech monopolies. Concentrated power in the hands of a few giants destroys innovation and equity.\nTechnology without conscience. Innovation devoid of ethical consideration is a path to societal decay.\nEnvironmental negligence. Ignoring the ecological impact of technological progress is unacceptable.\nThe only kind of abundance we can accept is one for all species.\nRedefining value creation through open innovation We aim to redefine value creation.\nWe prioritize collective innovation and societal impact over private profits.\nWe stand for an open, decentralized, collaborative economy.\nWe are committed to building the future of Work.\n1. Redefining the economic system We no longer believe in the current economic system.\nOur \u0026lsquo;capitalist\u0026rsquo; economy has led to an undemocratic world dictated by finance and controlled by tech monopolies, at the expense of human values.\nWe are modern serfs, sweating our dignity in exchange for digital dopamine shots. We are trapped in a consumerist illusion, acting as powerless users or buyers. We are passively watching our own extinction, made to believe there\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can do. We are ironically hoping for random tech \u0026lsquo;geniuses\u0026rsquo; billionaires to save us.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.\u0026rdquo;\nOur short-term profits-led economic system has created irreconcilable issues that turned into global challenges: climate change, loss of biodiversity, depletion of Earth\u0026rsquo;s resources, wealth and wage inequalities, political polarisation. And we—the workers and younger generations—want to end this system that we did not create. We understand that we won\u0026rsquo;t overcome these challenges without a drastic change in the way society operates.\nWhether \u0026lsquo;Capitalism\u0026rsquo; is the problem or not is irrelevant (in fact, Capitalism might have already been replaced with a form of Techno-feudalism, exploiting attention and platform rents, and it is far worse).\nOur current economic system is broken and it is our duty to fix it.\nWe, workers and consumers, hold the power.\nMoney is worth nothing if we don\u0026rsquo;t play by the established rules. Our human labor and intellectual contributions have value beyond monetary measures.\nWe resist alienation. We resist capital accumulation.\nWe want to contribute great, meaningful work.\nThe meaning of life. Why do we work? We work because we are humans.\nWe work to give meaning to our lives. We work to consciously, intentionally shape our surroundings. We work as a socially organized way to expand.\nIndividual motives might differ (search for meaning, mission, survival\u0026hellip;), but, collectively, our work serves a society-level accomplishment.\nWe work to create value.\nValue is a flowing abstract matter, it\u0026rsquo;s an exchange of power. Capital, on the other hand, is an accumulation of power.\nValue \u0026lsquo;creation\u0026rsquo; is trading one good for another, money for service, wage for skilled time. The amount of value \u0026lsquo;created\u0026rsquo; conceptually equals the underlying utility of the trade. And utility is defined socially—by us—: through markets, political structures, communities.\nWe defend our human right to solely work for goals and missions we believe in.\nValue vs. Price Value is what we want it to be.\nValue is all around us. Value is theoretical, highly-subjective, latent, speculative and immeasurable. \u0026ldquo;Value is in the eye of the beholder.\u0026rdquo;\nValue cannot be created. Value can be traded, actioned, and amplified.\nPrice is what we pay to access traded value.\nPrice is the instantaneous exchange value.\nIn theory, free markets should ensure \u0026lsquo;fair\u0026rsquo; prices. Meaning that,\nWe all pay the same price for the same good or service, It\u0026rsquo;s the optimal (i.e. lowest) price we could have paid. And, as utilitarians, we aim for the Pareto optimum: an optimal equilibrium situation where better for one would mean worse for others.\nWe believe in free markets to find the Pareto optimum. Free markets imply that,\nExchanges of value can happen freely (within the boundaries of human rights), Everyone can access and fully comprehend the marketplace, By design, no arbitrage (winning without risk) is possible. Freedom is required to efficiently, democratically value things.\nWe acknowledge that under constraint or influence, value is meaningless. For value to be, we must be able to freely want it to be.\nMoney and False promises Money is nothing more than the promise of an exchange of value.\nThroughout our lives, we all unequally collect \u0026lsquo;valuables\u0026rsquo; as capital:\nTime Influence Material and immaterial property Often, we perceive and want to access value in valuables that are not ours. (Maybe to provide for our material needs, comfort, or belonging.)\nIn order to access or obtain said desired valuables, a trade has to happen.\nGenerally, trading valuables for valuables isn\u0026rsquo;t convenient nor deemed fair. Therefore, money is a convenient proxy-valuable, one we can all price equally: a \u0026lsquo;commodity\u0026rsquo;.\nMoney was created as a means to an end: value \u0026lsquo;creation\u0026rsquo; (or rather value exchange). And indeed, it now is the most universal way to trade value.\nUnfortunately, too often, money has become the end itself.\nWe refuse to let money define collective value We won\u0026rsquo;t falter in finding alternative ways to exchange our value.\nWe won\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to refuse exchanging our value for money.\nGrowth is not progress We oppose associating growth and progress.\nWhile they are indeed correlated, we reject any form of causality. Progress can happen without growth and growth without progress.\nProgress is moving forward towards a destination.\nIf this destination isn\u0026rsquo;t an equitable and sustainable future through open innovation for all, then we don\u0026rsquo;t want it. We claim the right to disagree with the destination and disengage from the journey.\nWe refuse ill-defined, uninspired, purpose-less growth.\nGrowth is an increase in size. But the size of what?\nGDP? The amount of money in circulation? For whom? Resources used? On a resource-limited planet? The number of species going extinct? What for? \u0026hellip; Growth isn\u0026rsquo;t inherently good or bad. Neither is progress.\nWe deserve a better journey.\nDegrowth and progress We don\u0026rsquo;t want to work more. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to consume more. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to always have more.\nWe want to innovate faster and bigger. We want to invest more in meaningful progress. We want to explore ourselves, our planet, the universe.\nWe want to work less. We want to consume less. We want to have less, but better.\nWe want to live. We want to love. We want to laugh.\n2. The role of open innovation The future of innovation will be open or won\u0026rsquo;t be.\nOpen innovation is the only way to have healthy competition: one that benefits us all.\nTechnology, techno-optimism, won\u0026rsquo;t save us. Unless we join forces and cooperate now.\nOur generation is faced with immense, life-or-death challenges. We blame it on the previous generations. We blame it on the system. Yet, the only way forward is together. Collaborative, collective, cooperative.\nFor the sake of survival, we will bypass and confront the defenders of closed innovation.\nIndividualism vs. Collectivism We are individuals. We live first for ourselves, to survive.\nWe are communities. We live to belong to social groups.\nWe are humans. We live to care for others, and be cared for.\nWe believe in agency, in individualism. And yet, we also believe in collectivism.\nThe accomplishments of the free software movement and open source communities out there are testaments to the power of collectivism. And they did it despite the system.\nWe believe that humans are fundamentally good; despite bad events and anecdotes.\nWe celebrate the uniqueness of each individual, their right to think, create, and innovate independently. We recognize and advocate for the inherent power of personal freedom. We think that the diversity of thought and experience that each individual brings is the foundation for meaningful and deep innovation.\nWe acknowledge the incredible potential of collective action, where shared goals and mutual support lead to greater achievements than any individual could accomplish alone. We embrace the concept of community, understanding that togetherness is a source of strength and resilience.\nWe assert that the true essence of innovation lies in the harmony of both individual agency and collective effort.\nWe strive to create spaces where individuality is not lost in the collective, but rather, where it is celebrated and enabled to contribute to the greater good.\nWe believe in a world where individual aspirations and communal goals are not at odds but are used in synergies, driving us towards a more inclusive and sustainable future.\nCompetition vs. Cooperation Competition can be good; when it\u0026rsquo;s a race that encourages everyone to run faster. Competition can be bad; when the narrow focus on winning turns into fistfights.\nCooperation can be good; when it pools knowledge and resources for shared goals. Cooperation can be bad; when it suppresses individual initiative.\nAs techno-optimists, we too believe in competition. Because we too believe in evolution, and we too believe in life. We too believe in the truth.\nWe too believe rich is better than poor, cheap is better than expensive, and abundant is better than scarce. We too believe in making everyone rich, everything cheap, and everything abundant.\nYet we believe cooperation is a whole part of evolution. In fact, we don\u0026rsquo;t believe that evolution means letting anyone down.\nWe believe in cooperation because we believe it to be the reason why the human race evolved so far and so big. \u0026ldquo;Together we go further.\u0026rdquo;\nOur ability to cooperate, to suppress our primal instincts, is in fact our biggest and most human strength.\nWe are in the age of stories, the age of knowledge, the age of wisdom.\n3. Empowerment through decentralized participation Let\u0026rsquo;s push the emperors into the ocean Don\u0026rsquo;t need a goon to flirt with devotion With every hour, our number increases We\u0026rsquo;ll smash your institutions to pieces\nWe need a transformation One we all can see We need a revolution So long as we stay free\nWelcome to the desecration, baby We\u0026rsquo;ll build you right up and we\u0026rsquo;ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration, baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nFree your sons and unlock your daughters We\u0026rsquo;ll throw the baby out with the bathwater With every second our anger increases We\u0026rsquo;re gonna smash your nation to pieces.\nCurating identities Our identities are who we are. Our identities belong to us. Our identities are our values and our value.\nOnly we can curate our identities. Yet, digital platforms took it away from us; and corporate-exploited Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to go even further.\nAs knowledge isn’t scarce anymore, curated knowledge will be. But curated doesn’t mean much in a vacuum or outside of the human eye. Curated only means something because we are alive, conscious, social animals. \u0026lsquo;Curated\u0026rsquo; equals (=) identity.\nIdentity curation gives birth to communities. Communities forge identity and amplify value. Communities rightly blur the borders between work, life, and the third place.\nWe won\u0026rsquo;t let AIs curate our identities. We humans will organize. We will build communities to defend our humanity.\nWe proclaim our humanity.\nResource allocation The process of curation is the one of resource allocation: where is time, money, and influence being spent.\nWe believe resource allocation should be here to empower; never to disable. We believe that the exercise of resource allocation should happen freely.\nPrinciple We claim that knowledge must be freely accessible to all, providing the foundation for informed autonomy and enabling the collective intelligence necessary to address systemic issues and develop collective ambition.\nWe claim the freedom for communities to self-organize, and that societal structures should facilitate serendipitous innovation and resilience, ensuring that every individual has the same opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the collective effort to solve our biggest problems and achieve their own mission.\nJoin the movement\n\u0026ldquo;The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.\u0026rdquo; —John Maynard Keynes\n","permalink":"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/manifesto/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI authored last year a manifesto for the \u003ca href=\"https://fuckthevcs.com/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Fuck the VCs\u0026rdquo; project\u003c/a\u003e: a platform committed to challenging the status quo of the venture capital industry by creating the first open source investment community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe principles outlined in the manifesto resonate deeply with the broader themes that I explore here on my blog, particularly the ideals and ethics of open source.\nI truly enjoyed writing the Manifesto and figured its principles extend way further than the FTVCs initiative.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a call to action for creating a \u003ca href=\"../principle/\"\u003emore equitable\u003c/a\u003e and sustainable future through collaborative, human-centered innovation.\nIt feels very personal to me and I would read it anytime I am feeling low or need to remember why I do the things I do.\nI am excited to share it with you all here.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Manifesto. (Fuck the VCs.)"},{"content":"We work because we are humans. Looking back at humanity\u0026rsquo;s history, the evolution of our modes of subsistence shows how central the modes of production and the organisation of human labor are in providing for our material needs.\nHumans work in order to give meaning to their lives. We work in order to consciously, intentionally shape our surroundings. We work as a socially organised way to expand.\nWe work in order to create value.\nThe recent developments of Artificial Intelligence (AI)—and the theoretical perspective of AGI—are triggering us to wonder what the future of work will be. AI will have the power to do creative labor, something that was exclusive to humans so far. They will have the technical ability to replace humans for many of the common tasks that we call our jobs. Whether they can do better is the wrong question to ask; they will be cheaper, and economic incentives know better.\nHow will we provide for our material needs? What will work look like? Is—I believe—a better question. In fact, it raises multiple other, deeper questions: Why do we work? What is value? How might we redesign our economic system so that we can maximise happiness for the most?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my prediction: I believe the future of work will be open, collaborative, and decentralised.\nValue creation I will make this a topic for another, future post, but—in short—talking about value creation is absurd. This is especially true when considering its measurement in dollars.\nValue is theoretical, highly-subjective, latent, speculative and immeasurable. However, value can be traded, actioned, and amplified.\nActioning: turning a latent valuable into an exchangeable valuable. Trading: exchanging a valuable for another valuable, at an exchange value. Amplifying: combining valuables into a sum bigger than its parts. Often, discussions about value creation mix these three methodologies. If we are talking about it in the context of entrepreneurship, it will often be orderly amplifying, actioning, and last trading.\nTrading is the outcome. Economic value creation, measured as financial value creation, is currently focused on the tradable nature of value. Without a trade, value seems worthless from the perspective of our economic system. Looking at the global economy: the more and the faster the trades, the higher the value (often measured as GDP). The more value is being created. This has the unfortunate corollary that pure financial trades can make it look like value was created, misleading us.\nIn my last Common Tragedies post, I showed how this focus on the trading aspect leads to the destruction of common resources and does not incentivise selfless amplification. Essentially, this is because we can\u0026rsquo;t freely trade Commons (who would be the seller?) and that their amplified nature isn\u0026rsquo;t financially represented. Concretely: a forest is more than a sum of trees, or an open source project is more than the sum of intellectual property contributions.\nOpen innovation The future of work will be open. Closed-source innovation has led to greedy tech monopolies (and worse, investors\u0026rsquo; contradictory expectations for founders to build monopolies), enshittified platform products, and new feudalised markets.\nWe will have to embrace open knowledge in order to free innovation and drive progress forward. One way or another, this will eventually happen. History is cyclic and open innovation is the way forward. We deserve better knowledge, products, and services.\nDecentralised investment The future of work will be decentralised. Just as centralisation comes with closeness, openness brings decentralisation. Open innovation and the abstraction of our jobs will lead to a lot more solo-preneurs delivering specialised, personalised services to other humans.\nDistributed, decentralised trading won\u0026rsquo;t be limited to money anymore. Time, influence, and money are equally valuable investment currencies, and crypto-currencies allow us to model that. We will soon freely exchange one for the other without looking back at our old financial system.\nCommunities The future of work will be collaborative. As knowledge isn\u0026rsquo;t scarce anymore, curated knowledge will be. But curated doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean much in a vacuum or outside of the human eye. Curated only means something because we are alive, conscious, social beasts. Curated results from identity.\nCommunities will become the common unit. Communities forge identity and amplify value. Hoping that we won\u0026rsquo;t defer our identity curation to AI, I believe that communities will become the source of value. The borders between work, life, and side projects will get blurred.\nAction, trade, amplify We will action value with open innovation, trade it with decentralised investment, and amplify it with communities. That\u0026rsquo;s how I envision the future of work and value creation.\nAnd you, what do you think the future of work will look like?\nTwitter, BlueSky, DeSo/Diamond\n","permalink":"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/future-of-work/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe work because we are humans.

If the resource is finite, then its value will tragically be destroyed by this unrestrained consumption.\nWith the same analysis, we can explain how and why our current dominant economic system will eventually consume all of the available natural resources and destroy all living species. That is, unless proper regulations were to be globally adopted (Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action, Elinor Ostrom, 1992).\nTwo very different tragedies of the commons To some extent, open source isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a typical Tragedy of the Commons. In the case of open source, the present resource isn\u0026rsquo;t scarce nor finite. Once the intellectual property (knowledge) has been produced, its reproduction cost is zero. Therefore creating an abundance of the said free resource. There ends the analogy with Nature. (Private copying, reproduction costs, and the supply of intellectual property, Stanley M Besen, 1986)\nIndeed, the key issue with growth economic models is that they rely on the abundance of a resource, which most often isn\u0026rsquo;t the case. Especially when it comes to natural resources.\nSide-note: Free software is not a given To some, it might seem that \u0026lsquo;open source\u0026rsquo; (and its purest \u0026lsquo;free software\u0026rsquo; form) is a given. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s everywhere and a lot of companies are contributing to open source. So what\u0026rsquo;s the matter?\nI interchangeably use \u0026lsquo;free software\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;libre software\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;open source\u0026rsquo;. These are not always obvious synonyms. Many definitions exist. When I write my essays and notes, I consider \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; software if it comes with a license granting Access, Modification, Distribution rights to all. Read more on: opensource.org/licenses/.\nMany of our freedoms seem trivial today. We enjoy them without even realising they could be gone from one day to the other. But no freedom came without a fight.\nThe history of computing and the Internet is fascinating. The history of Free software even more (I encourage french-speakers to read \u0026ldquo;Une histoire de l\u0026rsquo;informatique\u0026rdquo; by P. Breton).\nFree software is an ideology. In the 80s, Richard Stallman —father of the Copytheft\u0026rsquo;s GPL licence, GNU project, and Free Software Foundation— shared the ideology originating thoughts and philosophy. Simplistically: software must be free (as in freedom) because we humans aim to be free and it was foreseen that eventually software would govern our human lives.\nIn 1991, Linus Torvalds boosted the GNU project by creating Linux and Git. These free projects would soon become the foundation for the entire modern computing stack.\nHowever, many times, corporations tried to destroy the free software movement. \u0026ldquo;The free-software movement, espoused by the Free Software Foundation, which Mr. Stallman has led since 1984, is far more ideological than the open-source philosophy. Free-software proponents argue that users should be free to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software they use. Mr. Stallman\u0026rsquo;s detractors have accused him of being everything from a communist to a thief. [\u0026hellip;] Microsoft senior vice president, Jim Allchin, accused the open-source movement of compromising the nation\u0026rsquo;s intellectual property law.\u0026rdquo; (New York Times, 2001). \u0026ldquo;Microsoft executives were blunt, describing open source software as a \u0026lsquo;short-term revenue and platform threat\u0026rsquo;, and expressing concerns that the movement’s \u0026lsquo;free idea exchange\u0026rsquo; would \u0026lsquo;present a long term developer mindshare threat\u0026rsquo; [\u0026hellip;] Microsoft subsequently used \u0026rsquo;everything in their marketing arsenal to discredit open source software’s reliability\u0026rsquo;, adopting familiar propagandistic rhetoric that described open source licenses using \u0026rsquo;three of the most feared words in the United States: cancer, communism, and un-American\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; (Open (For Business): Big Tech, Concentrated Power, and the Political Economy of Open AI, Wider, West, Whittaker, 2023).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that often coincidentally (sarcasm), corporations loosing their market share would suddenly become strong defenders of the free software movement. In fact, they regularly subsidised or developed it further: such as IBM and Red Hat in 1999, Google with Android in 2008 and then Kubernetes in 2014, and again Meta with LLaMa2 in 2023.\nIn conclusion, the existence of free software today is due to 1/ ideologies from the 80s powered by highly-talented developers, 2/ tech corporations trying to maintain their monopolies.\nOpen source is a self-replicating winner: the more is free, the more will be free. As long as funding is being injected, open source is and will be a default. The cloud-native software space is, in my opinion, the best example of open source software powered by monopolies.\nInstant value The value of open-source knowledge comes both from its past and its future, but not from its present state. Before: when the value is being created. And after: when the said resource\u0026rsquo;s value might decrease or even go negative in case sufficient maintenance isn\u0026rsquo;t provided (bugs, CVEs, malware etc). Its present state is free and infinite.\nThese are the two types of value that open source creates,\nPositive value: delivering an innovative solution to an outstanding problem, Negative value: requiring maintenance work in order to remain valuable. Both types are \u0026lsquo;\u0026rsquo;instant value\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; —comparable to power in an electricity market.\nOpen source factories Imagine if open source projects were knowledge factories and open source contributors were machines in these factories. Without power, these factories would be worth nothing. With power, with electricity, the machines can start functioning and delivering potential value.\nTake two of these factories. Depending on the number of machines and their type, the instant power of the two factories might differ. One might require 10kW and the other 5kW to function. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we budget 10kWh of energy for each. The first factory will be able to function for an hour and the second for two hours.\nAfter an hour, which of the two factories did deliver more value? With an energy budget of 10kWh, which of the two factories did deliver more value?\nWell, we don\u0026rsquo;t know. In fact, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter if one absorbed 100kWh and the other 1kWh. The only thing that matters is their outcome and its value to society (or rather, to the market).\nIt approximatively requires as much energy to build an iPhone 13 Pro Max (2021) than a Google Pixel 6 Pro (2021). And yet, the iPhone is 30% more expensive. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly how value is being defined in our economy.\nEnergy has a production cost and therefore is virtually limited. The selling price of the produced goods and services must be higher than its production cost, otherwise it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t create value and the company would quickly crash on the market and possibly go bankrupt.\nNote that companies have \u0026lsquo;innovation inertia\u0026rsquo;. They will often likely crash on the markets before going bankrupt. This will give them a last chance to innovate and turn the ship around.\nThe current economy is designed to maximise the price-cost=value equation.\nIn theory, this design should maximise the innovative value delivered by companies.\nIn practice, monopolies grew and tech companies now spend more energy fighting than innovating. In fact, there\u0026rsquo;s a significant decrease in productivity directly attributable to them.\nThe open source tragedy The tragedy of open source is that it\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic factory without electricity.\nOpen source has no business model. It\u0026rsquo;s not able to create added value as defined by our current economy and therefore not able to power itself. In other words: there\u0026rsquo;s no investment loop (= open source is not profitable).\nWhat is scarce is not open-source knowledge itself, as the created knowledge is abundant. What is scarce is the instant value of open source: the power of contributors. The maintainers. They are the tragically endangered Commons. What if they stopped working or being good?\nDespite open source being the best knowledge-innovation factory at our disposal, very few are willing to power it. In fact, why should anyone pay for electricity if everyone else is going to benefit from the produced knowledge as well? There it is: the same tragic destiny that Mother Earth is facing.\nAnd it gets worse ; if some people are willing to work for free, why should we even pay them? I often heard that \u0026lsquo;maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t want to get paid, maybe paying them will change them.\u0026rsquo;\n-Breathe.-\nThe economy should be here to serve humanity, not the opposite.\nIf the current state of our economy is slowing down (or even, not speeding up) innovation, then our economy is broken (or, malfunctioning).\nA good starting point for learning about the Economy is Gilles Mitteau\u0026rsquo;s book \u0026ldquo;Tout sur l\u0026rsquo;économie\u0026rdquo; (unfortunately again another french-speakers-only recommendation)\nMarkets as a tool in our belt Financial markets are a powerful tool to incentivise value creation and the unstoppable race to innovation. We successfully used them to drive years of incredible technological progress.\nUnfortunately, the current version of our financial markets might well destroy humanity.\nUnless we successfully create the market incentives to invest back into the \u0026lsquo;Commons\u0026rsquo;.\nCuration markets: New economies About seven years go, @simondlr started writing about Curation Markets. A new kind of financial instrument that would be able to create the incentives to Save the Planet.\nThe principle is simple: tokenising a scarce resource and using a mathematical formula to dynamically incentivise more future investments. This results in a financial market with clear rules, ability to make a profit \u0026amp; influence the game, and potential value creation.\nDeSo adopted this principle to tokenise influencers\u0026rsquo; popularity on social networks and allow them to leverage it to fund their own content and the future of their influencer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Brand\u0026rsquo;.\nThe outcome is New Economies: Creator Economy, Gig Economy, Curation Economy, etc.\nNote that new economies are just tools as well. They aren\u0026rsquo;t inherently good or bad (in fact, nothing is). However, arguably, the uncertainty of gigs and creators\u0026rsquo; revenues (vs waged work) is a problem. This is something that could be solved through regulations —such as implementing a Universal Base Income— or worker collectives, cooperatives, that could solve this problem with socialising the risks with an \u0026lsquo;insurance\u0026rsquo; risk-smoothing model.\nCreating new economies is hard, especially within the current global economy. The new economy must first validate two key hypotheses: value creation and growth. In addition, economies are subject to network effects and require \u0026lsquo;fuel\u0026rsquo; (= money) to power them.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t much different to creating a new venture. In fact, Uber, AirBnB and many others are platform-type ventures that successfully created new economies. It\u0026rsquo;s just much harder.\nInvesting in open source\u0026rsquo;s future The same thing can be done with open source: Incentivising investors and consumers to pay for the electricity that powers the open source factories.\nValue creation hypothesis In fact, some corporations and public entities are already paying to maintain and develop specific, popular open-source projects. They are subsidising their instant value creation. And the most successful open-source projects even are able to sell extra services on top (Related read: \u0026ldquo;Investing in Open Source: The FOSS Contributor Fund\u0026rdquo;, Duane O’Brien and Mandy Grover, Indeed, 2022).\nThis is the value creation hypothesis: the instant value delivered by open-source projects is valuable to other economic agents with strong economic motives to subsidise it.\nIt might be new projects that will give them a competitive market edge over their proprietary competitors, or maintaining older projects that they use or will use as critical dependencies.\nIn an EU commission-requested report, the Fraunhofer institute concluded that for every additional 1€ injected in subsidising open source, close to 800€ would be created in the global European economy as an increase of the bloc\u0026rsquo;s GDP (Study about the impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the EU economy, Fraunhofer, 2021).\nThe instant value is a \u0026lsquo;Common\u0026rsquo; ; but, together, the economic agents realise that they might financially benefit from subsidising it successfully.\nGrowth hypothesis Wait, but why aren\u0026rsquo;t big corporations forking free projects and maintaining their own versions? Because the sum is greater than its parts. Forking Ubuntu sure gives you a fully-working Linux Distribution\u0026hellip; but it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;Ubuntu\u0026rdquo; anymore. It isn\u0026rsquo;t able to attract future contributions.\nThe value created by open-source projects is in their name. Not their Intellectual Property (it belongs to their authors), nor their License (it\u0026rsquo;s free to use for everyone), nor their usage (it\u0026rsquo;s by-design commoditised, as anyone can run it at-cost). The value of an open-source project vs another is its brand: its ability to attract more users, contributors, and potential investments.\nThe \u0026lsquo;brand\u0026rsquo; of an open-source project, its identity, is the result of many intangibles: the governance of the project, its roadmap and prioritisation decisions, the quality of its contributions, the names of its contributors, its documentation, its vision and ideology, etc.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter whether the project\u0026rsquo;s contributions are getting paid or not. In fact, more than 80% of the contributions to Linux are from paid developers often working for big corporations. Late 1999, even IBM strategically spent 1B$ on the Linux project trying to disrupt their evil child (=Microsoft). It probably was the first time that a big corporation used free, open source to successfully disrupt a market.\nThis is the growth hypothesis: the more a project brand is able to attract contributions, the more valuable it gets and the more it will be able to attract future contributions.\nA corollary is that the more projects are being open-sourced, the more will be.\nFrom over-the-counter transactions to a market As said, over-the-counter transactions are already happening and some economic agents are already subsidising open-source projects\u0026rsquo; instant value creation and economic future.\nIt mostly happens through \u0026lsquo;Foundations\u0026rsquo; like the Linux Foundation and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. In my opinion, the investment motivation for Big Tech to participate in these Foundations is quite transparent: they want to maintain their already-established monopolies and their control over innovation.\nOpen source is a powerful disruption tool to control markets. If one has enough capital, one can fund open-source alternatives to their competitors and maintain —or regain— their market domination. The open-sourcing of generative AI models is an interesting data point to support this analysis (although, it arguably isn\u0026rsquo;t truly open source).\nOverall, a generic rule appears: economic agents are willing to subsidise open source if they can gain a strategic benefit out of it and if they are not the only ones to be paying for it.\nThis is a similar hypothesis to the one of the crowdfunding approach.\nAn interesting side effect of crowdfunding is that it creates a marketplace: with the last transaction setting the price for something that would otherwise be too abstract to valuate.\nAs an open source contributor, you would now be able to directly compare your funding to other similar projects and to level your instant value pricing. By default, one Watt is the same as another Watt, what may make it more or less valuable is the perspective of what will get built.\nThe Open Market: a crowdfunded FLOSS venture capital The Open Market is a proposed new economy and financial market to:\nCrowdfund open source\u0026rsquo;s instant value creation, Estimate and invest into open source\u0026rsquo;s future value creation. A curation market to crowdfund instant value creation For years I had in mind the principles of an \u0026lsquo;Open Market\u0026rsquo;, a platform that would systematically give market value to open-source innovation. Contributors would get fairly rewarded for the instant value they delivered, projects would be able to attract funding and contributions, consumers would be able to influence the future of their favorite projects, and investors would be able to bet on the future of innovation.\nThis is the logical conclusion to what I wrote above: a platform to fund open source.\nFor it to be successful, the incentives must be aligned. There must be a clear and shared definition of \u0026lsquo;value\u0026rsquo;, allowing for a profit motive. As discussed, with open source projects, this is what the \u0026lsquo;brand\u0026rsquo; represents. It\u0026rsquo;s the ability of a project to attract future contributions. That\u0026rsquo;s what the yet-not-materialised open source market values.\nIf you are raising funding for your open source project and you need 100kWh to make it happen, the value of the required energy will depend on the perspective of what you want to build.\nMoney(t) = Brand(t) / Time(t)\nWith Money the funding raised, Brand the perceived project\u0026rsquo;s value, and Time the work (energy) required to make it happen. —see another representation in Why open source?\nTurning open source brands into commodities What if you could reward contributors with a share of what they built ; i.e. pay Linux maintainers with a share of \u0026lsquo;Linux\u0026rsquo;. Together, they would own the name of the brand that they created.\nPreviously over-the-counter transactions would now happen through this open source brands market. The price of the last transaction would represent the market value of the said brand.\nThe more a project is able to attract new contributions, especially paid ones, the higher its market value (read about Curation Markets). Of course, speculators would also want to enter the game. They would start betting on which project will be able to attract the most transactions in the future. Doing so, they will create liquidity for contributors to cash out at a market price.\nSome projects will crash. Especially if they make strategic decisions that are non-beneficial to their paying investor-customers. Then, their perceived ability to attract future contributions will go down and so will their market value. Some investor-contributors might make a loss. It is expected that a fork project would then adapt to the demand and attract new contributions.\nSome projects will never attract paid contributions. They will have a market cap of zero and their contributors would work for free, paid with shares of a vision or an ideology.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m describing here is very close to the stock-equity market and the entrepreneurship, venture capital world. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what it is ; but making two fundamentally different axioms: intellectual property must be free and the work of contributors must be free.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a FLOSS venture capital market.* (*Free and Libre Open Source Software)\nThis probably won\u0026rsquo;t help funding your random open-source app, but this will open profitable perspectives of market success despite being open source (or, because of being open source).\nIn fact, entering this market while not being open source would represent a high risk —same as a company becoming public without publishing their financial results. We might decide to make it illegal to do so, but even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the risk would probably be too big for investors anyway.\nHey you! I am right now actively building this Open Market idea as a combination of a non-profit Foundation and a start-up. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to discuss and maybe jump on board, please do reach out (Twitter, BlueSky, LinkedIN). I have the vision \u0026amp; strategy, now building a team.\nSo, can we save the planet? A similar Curation Market could be envisioned to value natural resources, thus reversing the tragedy of the commons, and saving the planet (read @simondlr\u0026rsquo;s vision).\nOn paper, it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful. But it likely won\u0026rsquo;t happen. At least, not without global regulations.\nNature vs Open source Open source contributors have immense leverage: what if they stopped working?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the same leverage that employees have over employers to increase their salaries. What if they stopped working? They could unionise and go on strike, or they could just go. The offer meets the demand and create an equilibrium: the markets are playing their desirable role. In fact, this power balance is not only desirable, it\u0026rsquo;s required for markets to function properly.\nOpen source is everywhere and embedded itself as a critical dependency to almost every businesses today ; even if they haven\u0026rsquo;t yet all acknowledged it. As OSS Capital rightly puts it on their website, \u0026ldquo;Open Source is eating software itself faster than software is eating the world.\u0026rdquo;\nUnfortunately, Nature can\u0026rsquo;t go on strike.\nWhile open source won\u0026rsquo;t exist if we don\u0026rsquo;t power it, Nature doesn\u0026rsquo;t have this leverage. Natural resources are easy to abuse —and often won\u0026rsquo;t complain. That\u0026rsquo;s why regulations are needed. We —as citizens— need to go on strike in the name of Nature. We need to lobby for it. We must unionise natural resources and make them expensive to use as our most precious good.\nA word on nature going on strike I take back what I wrote before: Nature can and will go on strike. In fact, it has already started demonstrations —it\u0026rsquo;s show time. As we abused our natural resources for too long, bad consequences are starting to happen. Sadly, when this happens it\u0026rsquo;s often too late.\nOf course it isn\u0026rsquo;t intentional. That\u0026rsquo;s systemic consequences to our systemic actions.\nWe, as humans, must fix our system before it\u0026rsquo;s too late for good. We want to survive.\nOpen Market consequences: degrowth and a new economy De-growth is inevitable in order to avoid the tragic fate of the \u0026lsquo;Commons\u0026rsquo;.\nWe must regulate and decrease our use of resources. We must learn to co-exist with other species without destroying their environment and tampering their living conditions.\nWe must buy less, consume less, want less, do less, travel less\u0026hellip;\nUnfortunately, the design of our currently dominant economic system requires growth. When less money is being spent in the economy, painful crisis happen. Ironically, crisis lead to less spendings and unfortunate vicious consequences.\nFinancial crisis are never a good time or context to save the planet humanity.\nAssuming we won\u0026rsquo;t change our global economy in time, we need to find a hack.\nTechnological growth vs Production growth Observing the status quo, we can split growth in two distinct categories:\nTechnological growth: also known as \u0026lsquo;progress\u0026rsquo;, or innovation / expanding knowledge, Production growth: technically the current economic growth, a.k.a. \u0026lsquo;more goods\u0026rsquo;. The latter is the problem. Producing always more goods and services require always more energy and natural resources, which leads us to sell our souls and destroy our celestial home.\nIn a world with finite resources, infinite growth isn\u0026rsquo;t credible ; abundance is theoretical.\nIn fact, the problem with our current economy is that the two types of growth are intertwined.\nIf we could have technological growth without production growth, we would be fine (and only in that case it could be credible that technology might save us).\nToday, for technological growth to happen, we must sell always more goods \u0026amp; services in order to create surplus value and extract profit that will then, in part, fund the next technologies.\nWhen you add to that the current innovation inefficiencies coming from monopolies, unhappy alienated —inefficient— workers, arbitrary development, capital-markets inertia, \u0026hellip; our chances that technology and innovation will be in time to save us are pretty low to inexistent.\nOpen innovation economy With the proposed Open Market economy, we are splitting the \u0026lsquo;innovation\u0026rsquo; economy from the traditional \u0026lsquo;production\u0026rsquo; economy. We are powering a much more efficient, need-driven, free, open-innovation economic engine.\nKnowledge will expand without the need to sell always more goods and services. As knowledge will now be free, it\u0026rsquo;ll be abundant. Everyone will exploit it to their needs.\nAs a consequence, traditional businesses will be able to offer at-cost, cheap goods and services. Their incentive won\u0026rsquo;t anymore be to produce always more, rather to produce \u0026lsquo;better\u0026rsquo;.\nIn order to be more profitable than their competitors, businesses will need to deliver their goods and services while lowering their production costs. Meaning: decreasing their use of resources.\nCreative, un-commoditised, differentiated work will be highly valued. For example: arts, politics, personalised services will still be relevant and even more highly valued by consumers.\nIn this new macro economy ; Successful businesses would:\nExploit free knowledge to deliver commoditised goods and services, Optimise their use of natural resources in order to increase their profit margins, Increase the amount of differentiated labour to deliver highly-personalised solutions, Selfishly invest back some of their profits into open innovation in order to create more value. Consumers would:\nAccess goods and services at a fair, cheap price, Consume less as business incentives now are to produce better, Access higher-quality goods and services based on open innovation, Spend part of their budget directly on crowdfunding desirable innovation. Open source contributors would:\nWork freely on projects they value, responding to market incentives, Sell or trade their earned shares in order to diversify and cash out when needed, (Maybe: form cooperatives to ensure more stable and sustainable revenue streams.) Investors would:\nBuy and hold shares of projects they think will increase in value with time (= take risks), Spend money on making their project-investments more attractive, funding development. (Maybe: fund free open source contributors as free innovation entrepreneurs.) Bonus: Isn\u0026rsquo;t AI going to destroy humanity anyway? Maybe. It\u0026rsquo;s up to us.\nOnce more, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is just a tool. Nothing is either good or bad.\nAI-powered systems are starting to generate undifferentiated, \u0026lsquo;creative\u0026rsquo; labour. Yet, their nature makes them likely to quickly get commoditised (the use of the AI models , not their output).\nIt might mean that many so-far-human-only arts and crafts will eventually get disrupted by AI and that AIs will eventually compete with humans and make our labour less valuable.\nIf we don\u0026rsquo;t make clear conscious human decisions today, choosing an AI over a human for creative labour-type of work will happen for cost motives. Additionally, their output might very soon become at least as good, if not better, than those of even above-average humans.\nAt this point, I believe that we need to remember Why we work. Beyond the economic system and the profit motives, humans work to give meaning to their lives and consciously, intentionally shape their world. We work because we are humans.\nAI will have the ability to do that for us.\nThe question is not whether AI will be capable of doing it. The question is how do we -as humans- want that to happen.\nAnd we can\u0026rsquo;t let our economic system choose for us ; we know the outcome.\nWe need conscious human decisions now.\nHuman constructs, Technology and Economy, are here to serve humans. Not the opposite.\n(This post is part of the \u0026ldquo;Open Market\u0026rdquo; series)\n","permalink":"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/saving-the-planet/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my last post —\u003ca href=\"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/\"\u003eWhy Open Source isn\u0026rsquo;t Profitable\u003c/a\u003e—, I explain the \u003ca href=\"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/#the-curse-of-competition\"\u003eCurse of Competition\u003c/a\u003e as a sort of \u003ca href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1724745\"\u003eTragedy of the Commons\u003c/a\u003e: because open-source intellectual property is free to access, all economic agents will exploit it without giving back (a.k.a. as the \u003cem\u003efree riders\u003c/em\u003e issue).

Open-source software delivers an added value close to or below zero. As the price for using it is zero so is the added value, no matter the production cost.\nBut if we measured the value as the amount of cascading innovation or progress added to society, then it should be trivial that open source projects have the biggest societal added value.\nOn the other hand, proprietary tech often has a theoretically-infinite added value as the production cost can be averaged to zero across sales.\nHow can this contradiction be true? My conclusion is that the market is broken. In the sense that (in my opinion) it\u0026rsquo;s not doing its valuation job properly, therefore impacting our economy.\nDisclaimer: I never studied the fields of Economy and Finance. Forgive my simplifications and naive assumptions. Don\u0026rsquo;t make any investment decision based on my notes.\nThe creation of value In our current—Capitalist—economy, Intellectual Property (IP) and Human Labor are seen just the same as any other Production Means.\nThey can be traded and used to create value. But they aren\u0026rsquo;t value.\nBy axiomatic design, labor and IP aren\u0026rsquo;t free (as in freedom): They are constrained in order to produce value. They are just means to an end (in that case, profit).\nValue is what comes out of the profitable exploitation of all these various resources.\n\u0026ldquo;Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.\u0026rdquo; —Warren Buffett\nA (convenient) corollary is that Capital only has to be measured as an amount of Money.\nIn theory, open source is hugely profitable If you manage to have Open Source developers contribute for free to your project (or that you just use freely available software to enable your business), then your business\u0026rsquo; added value is hugely increased as you reduced your production cost.\nEnd users don\u0026rsquo;t (have to) care that your code is freely available. For most of them, the only thing they care about is your end product quality and its price (in that case, most often free).\nSo why does it not always work like this?\nThe curse of competition The competitive market is designed to optimise the use of resources.\nIf you open sourced your business-critical software (IP) with a true Open Source Licence (ie granting See, Edit, and Share rights), then your competitors would be able to simply copy your core value and start competing with you for a $0 entry cost.\nEventually, your only way to be more profitable than your competitors—i.e. to create more value—would be to minimise your use of resources. At the end, with enough competition, your customers (market consumers) should be able to pay for exactly what was the production cost of what you are selling (in = out).\nThis is a—sort of—ideal competitive market. At least, from a short-term consumer perspective.\nBut optimising resources also means compromising on the cost of Labor and IP. With unregulated (or not-\u0026ldquo;enough\u0026rdquo;-regulated) competition, this leads to poorly paid workers and unbearable working conditions. And/or to really bad products.\nIn the end, it also means no more investment in IP—i.e. no more Innovation: without added value, there\u0026rsquo;s no investment feedback loop.\nIn fact, for your hypothetical company that just decided to open source its business-critical software, it gets even worse. Because you initially invested capital (=money) in the labor (=time) that went into creating your business-critical software, you are now loosing money. Your competitors on the other hand could enter the game at no cost.\nAs a consequence , an open sourcing strategy would lead to your company going bankrupt (or almost bankrupt) and leaving behind a commoditised market.\nA note on corporations abusing open source contributors There are a few open sourcing strategies that don\u0026rsquo;t end with bankruptcy.\nHowever, most of them are not true open source. In fact, most of them are just tricking open source contributors into doing free work for the benefit of a for-profit company.\nMostly, we distinguish:\nOpen core: the hybrid model (Mattermost, Elastic\u0026hellip;). Consulting services: the Red Hat model. Brand value: the Ubuntu model. Disruption tool: the Google model. Dual-licensing: the Meta (and Docker) model. In my opinion, \u0026lsquo;open core\u0026rsquo; is an insult to the open source ideology, it\u0026rsquo;s like a honey pot tricking users and contributors into your ecosystem. But then the value-adding features are close source. The worse kind is the reversed \u0026lsquo;close core (backend) open client (frontend)\u0026rsquo;, then you really are just exploiting free work for your own benefit. Unfortunately, this is an often necessary and a sometimes a quite smart commercial or marketing strategy.\nConsulting services are a very smart and functional business model. It worked well for Red Hat for some time. The only (non-negligible) downside is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale. It requires 1:1 hiring and therefore profits often can\u0026rsquo;t compete with close-source solutions.\nBrand value is an interesting one. It\u0026rsquo;s basically implying that a fork (copy) of e.g. \u0026ldquo;Ubuntu\u0026rdquo; is worth nothing if you cannot name it \u0026ldquo;Ubuntu\u0026rdquo;. Brand valuation has three main downsides:\nIt takes time and resources to build, It\u0026rsquo;s hard to quantify, And it\u0026rsquo;s worth nothing if you can\u0026rsquo;t leverage it (i.e. sell something at a higher price). Using open source as a disruption tool is also a very interesting and clever one. Google utilised this strategy many times, for example with Android and Kubernetes, in order to disrupt markets where they were not the number one (and therefore, losing —as tech markets are \u0026lsquo;winner takes it all\u0026rsquo; situations). This approach not directly profitable, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good strategy to get there. It\u0026rsquo;s also not directly abusing open source contributors; but it\u0026rsquo;s still arguably persuading workers to do free labor for an end that is essentially of benefit to you as a for-profit economic agent.\nFinally, the Dual-licensing model is a quite new and interesting model. Meta utilised it with \u0026ldquo;LLaMa2\u0026rdquo; (although the open-source nature of models is discussable). The strategy consists of using a conditional Licence. If you\u0026rsquo;re a free rider but not making a profit, you can keep using it for free. However, if you start being profitable thanks to the use of the open-sourced product, then you fall into the proprietary part of the Licence and have to seek a commercial agreement.\nSuccessful open source companies today are a combination of multiple of these commercialisation strategies.\nI am a defender of the \u0026lsquo;open source should always be free\u0026rsquo; church, and therefore I don\u0026rsquo;t consider Dual-licensing or Open core as true open source. Consulting services and Brand value are great strategies but are really hard to leverage and scale. And finally, the Disruption tool strategy is smart but doesn\u0026rsquo;t serve an immediately leverage-able end.\nOpen source can\u0026rsquo;t create value in a Capitalist economy *Open source can\u0026rsquo;t create Value in a traditional Capitalist economy\nBy axiomatic definition, the open source ideology defines labor and Intellectual Property (IP) as being free (as in freedom). This is opposed to the Capitalism axioms explained before.\nTherefore, Open Source and Capitalism are incompatible.\nThese principles, or rather Axioms, are like the Laws of Physics of a Capitalist Economy and of Open Source. One one side, that\u0026rsquo;s how Investors can make a Profit thanks to their Capital. On the other side, that\u0026rsquo;s why Open Source contributors are willing to work.\nRedefining Capital All these thoughts and ideas occupied my mind for quite some time. And I really couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand how to make sense of them and find a solution. Or at least one that didn\u0026rsquo;t involve global, coordinated, marxist-style regulations. Until I read the vision statement of DeSo.\nWhat they were building there at DeSo is a decentralised social network leveraging \u0026ldquo;Influence\u0026rdquo; (ie, some kind of Brand value) effectively as Capital. You could now invest your Influence, trade someone else\u0026rsquo;s Influence, accumulate and bet on someone\u0026rsquo;s—or your own—future Influence.\nIn parallel, the fact that cryptos markets (DeFi) were able to (at least temporarily) move the traditional Global Economy (TradFi) was a Proof of Concept that building a new, decentralised, \u0026ldquo;web3\u0026rdquo;-style Economy could transform the Global System (interesting read on DeFi vs TradFi regulations).\nMoney, Time, and Influence as Capital (= Value) If we start considering Time (=work), Influence, and Money as equivalent investment methodologies to build Capital, instead of production means, we have a shot at solving the unsolvable (\u0026ldquo;A capitalist is somebody who stakes what is for what could be\u0026rdquo;).\nCapital is free. It belongs to everyone. The question is \u0026ldquo;who is able to leverage it, and who isn\u0026rsquo;t?\u0026rdquo; (topic for a later essay).\nMy principle is that:\nKnowledge shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be capitalised, Everyone should have access to capital, All investment should lead to shares. Brand(t) = Time(t) x Money(t) The only thing we need to do to solve the open source valuation problem is to create a new economy that sets Time (=Work), Money, and Brand (=Influence) as equivalent parameters of Value creation.\nThe equation of such system could be: Brand(t) = Time(t) x Money(t).\nProject investors (including investor-leaders, investor-contributors, and investor-consumers) would then compete in order to build the most valuable Brand on the market. They would do so by defining a governance, culture, making decisions and investments in order to create an identity (the Brand) that is the best at serving their consumers (=users).\nAs software is meant to go to trash (or—in more positive words—is never finished), this would equal to the projects able to attract the most contributions.\nThe gift of open competition Open competition (= all projects must be open source) would guarantee the most fair, most innovative, most profitable (for society) race.\nThis new economy only addresses and solves the innovation market (Knowledge). The traditional market (TradFi) would still need to co-exist in order to support resource-centric businesses and other consulting (Partner-type of) businesses: goods and services.\nA change in ideology would ideally mean that workers would eventually collaboratively own factories as they aren\u0026rsquo;t profitable to former investors anymore. Only freed human labor would then be able to get leveraged to create value in the form of knowledge.\nEventually, the only resources left to optimise in the traditional economy would be natural resources (energy, materials) and commoditised labor (=the one that will eventually be replaced by robotisation and automation).\nAs a consequence, this new economy would effectively leverage the traditional economy in order to optimise the use of natural resources and maximise innovation.\nDisrupting the Capitalist economy In this new economy, profit will still be possible and still be the incentive. It would however now mostly happen on the side of the new, open economy as traditional resource-centric businesses get commoditised. The profit incentive will reward investors (both traditional capitalists with money and new investor-contributors with work) in shares.\nIn addition, some profit would still be possible within the traditional economy. Human labor being the only non-commoditised source of value. Profitable businesses with differentiated competitive value coming from non-commoditised labor would still exist. For example, partner-type businesses: lawyer firms, investment funds, restaurants, etc.\nEventually, added value would come exclusively from human creativity.\nEventually, Humans as freed workers would educate more and more in order to collectively keep creating undifferentiated Value (i.e., be more creative and skilled workers).\n(This post is part of the \u0026ldquo;Open Market\u0026rdquo; series)\n","permalink":"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn a Capitalist economy, Open Source has no (direct) value.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"open-source-is-not-profitable\"\u003eOpen source is not profitable\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a few definitions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe price is the exchange value of a good or a service in a socio-economic context,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe production cost is what it costs to build a good or deliver a service,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadded value is the price minus the production cost.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen-source software delivers an \u003cem\u003eadded value\u003c/em\u003e close to or below zero.

But you needed to read it. In fact, this post is more about life than death. It\u0026rsquo;s more of a wake-up call, an invitation even.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a firm believer that our life choices are investments that shape the value and meaning we extract from life itself. Yes, we\u0026rsquo;re all going to die; get over it. But surely, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave this world with a life unlived. There\u0026rsquo;s no perfect time to start investing it wisely and bravely.\nAlso, remember it\u0026rsquo;s all about what you aim to achieve. Some equate \u0026ldquo;living life fully\u0026rdquo; with experiencing intense physical sensations. Some find fulfilment in helping others or creating something new. What\u0026rsquo;s undeniable is that a life lived fully requires taking risks. Why? Because ambitious investment inherently involves risk.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s your mission?\nIt might sound like a pretty naive question—after all, our existence is quite random. But hold that thought. Now that you\u0026rsquo;re part of a somewhat orderly society, free from the primal instinct of survival, how do you plan to spend your time?\nWe are all born billionaires: Time billionaires. About 2.5 billion seconds. And somehow, I believe we each have a mission. Something meaningful we yearn to accomplish with that time.\nFor me, I distilled my mission into the following statement: \u0026ldquo;To increase human intelligence, both individual and collective, while ensuring my happiness and those of others around me.\u0026rdquo;\nAs documented by Viktor E. Frankl, our primary motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life. Ultimately, an individual\u0026rsquo;s specific mission or purpose in life is unique to them; and discovering it can happen differently. Through great work or encountering someone. As Frankl put it, \u0026ldquo;Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognise that it is he who is asked.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s what keeps us going.\nYou might be thinking, \u0026ldquo;Well, I can\u0026rsquo;t just backpack around the world or quit my job to write a novel. I\u0026rsquo;ve got responsibilities!\u0026rdquo;. And I get that. We all do. But remember, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require big changes. Helping your child with their homework or even just taking a moment to breathe —that\u0026rsquo;s living, assuming you put meaning into it.\nSo, are you living? Why are you doing this thing you\u0026rsquo;re doing? Or rather, why aren\u0026rsquo;t you doing what you\u0026rsquo;re not doing but wish you were?\nLet’s live.

Taking the bus to meet a friend? That\u0026rsquo;s an investment. Quitting your job to work at another company? That\u0026rsquo;s investing. Skipping the gym? Bad investment, but still one. Going to bed early? Probably a good investment. So let me give you my best investment advice: spend your time wisely. Imagine you are a millionaire and you are placing your entire fortune into 24 chunks of money every day.\nFrom the online Cambridge dictionary, we get the following definition: \u0026ldquo;Invest, verb. To put money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit or get an advantage.\u0026rdquo;\nThinking about this, I mostly consider three investment currencies: Time, Money, and Influence. There surely is more that you can invest into something, but simplistically my opinion is there should be a way to express it as a function of Time, Money, and Influence.\nYou may be thinking this is all wrong, that not everything you do is motivated by \u0026ldquo;making a profit or getting an advantage.\u0026rdquo; And I want to argue you\u0026rsquo;re looking at this the wrong way. Profit is not a bad thing, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be money nor an immediate advantage. In fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m writing anything controversial here: your future is influenced by your many decisions. If you expand the perspectives of what is it that you consider an \u0026ldquo;investment\u0026rdquo; and what is it that you consider a \u0026ldquo;profit\u0026rdquo;, investment goes way beyond money and finance schemes.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s my point. Let me entertain.\nLimiting our view of what investment is to the joys of finance, or at least not seeing our time and influence as equal investment modes, we restrict our ability to have an impact. We are made to believe we need to work in order to get money in order to — if we have some left — invest some. More than a belief, this is indeed what \u0026ldquo;pays the bill\u0026rdquo;. But what if instead of receiving money as a salary you got paid in stocks? That\u0026rsquo;s what some companies do as \u0026ldquo;an incentive\u0026rdquo;. But shouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be the norm? And what if instead of buying your groceries in dollar bills you were trading stocks?\nMoney is convenient. But money is just a transactable token. Without momentum, inert money is worth nothing. Money should always be a mean, never an end.\nTime is a particularly interesting one. Environmental factors aside, Time is the ultimate non-renewable investment resource. Once spent, it\u0026rsquo;s gone forever. And if Money and Influence can buy and leverage Time, they can\u0026rsquo;t create it. It\u0026rsquo;s also a rather fair resource, in that each of us get more or less the same amount to spend (not exactly but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t compare — yet — with the discrepancies in Money or Influence distribution.)\nModern, industrialised societies managed to steal us the freedom of investing our time. If you fit the mold, how much time is left for you at the end of the day to invest in things you truly want? There are ways to adopt a minimalist lifestyle, care less about materialism and money, become as independent as possible from industrialised supply chains\u0026hellip; but this is still quite marginal.\nTrue accomplishment is the freedom to choose where to invest your time.\n(This post is part of the \u0026ldquo;Open Market\u0026rdquo; series)\n","permalink":"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/all-we-do-is-investment/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAll we are doing is investment.

I believe that Open Source is now facing an existential crisis and requires a sustainable funding model, and that a decentralized crypto market can provide that solution.\nThis upcoming series of posts truly fits with the vision of the Mind the gap blog. I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing about a topic close to my heart —Open Source funding—, and directly contributing to my own mission: enhancing individual and collective human intelligence. The series will be a complex puzzle made up of many pieces and deep reflections I\u0026rsquo;ve been nurturing for a while.\nThere is an issue with the modern society\u0026rsquo;s approach to Work and how it values —or, in my view, fails to appreciate— individual contributions adequately. I am a believer that individuals should be able to live from their collective contributions. This topic finds interesting parallels with recent debates and demonstrations over retirement policies in France —my home country.\nMy stance on this matter isn\u0026rsquo;t easily distilled into a single sentence, but if I were to attempt it, I\u0026rsquo;d say I envision a world where everyone can earn a living from their craft and contribute solely to causes they believe in. Realizing this vision calls for a significant societal shift —a form of \u0026lsquo;de-alienation\u0026rsquo;— where people feel a real connection to the results of their work, possibly fostered through communities collaborating on projects. Time is the ultimate currency and the biggest investment one can make. No one will get to live twice.\nIn this context, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking of a market that shifts its focus from pure profit to societal benefit as a method to assess these projects\u0026rsquo; value. This concept does not imply a specific governance model for individual projects or society overall. This \u0026lsquo;open market\u0026rsquo;—a concept I\u0026rsquo;ll elaborate on in future posts— could support democratic governance, steering individual contributions towards successful (or in other words, beneficial-to-society) products and services.\nOpen Source communities and projects provide encouraging examples of what this world could look like. Unfortunately, a sustainable business model to back these communities is yet to be found. As it stands, Open Source struggles to survive beyond the umbrella of large corporations and their strategic open-sourced code repositories. Even then, big corporations are giving up on true Open Source. I actually genuinely worry that free, libre, software (\u0026ldquo;Open Source\u0026rdquo;) might stand at the precipice of extinction.\nMy dream? Finding a systemic way to financially support an Open Source world —an open platform to sustainably invest in free software. Meanwhile, I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing a series of posts related to this subject, in the hopes of sparking stimulating discussions.

This magical use of containers, neural networks, and Kubernetes is packed with helpful resources and a fun way to dive into deep learning!\nA version of Part 1 and Part 2 of this article was first published on Ubuntu’s blog.\nA few words about OpenVINO on Ubuntu containers Docker image security isn’t only about provenance and supply chains; it’s also about the user experience. More specifically, the developer experience.\nAs the most popular container image in its category, the Ubuntu base image provides a seamless, easy-to-set-up experience. From public cloud hosts to IoT devices, the Ubuntu experience is consistent and loved by developers. In this blog, you’ll see that using Ubuntu Docker images greatly simplifies component containerization. We even used a prebuilt \u0026amp; preconfigured container image for NGINX.\nWhen you’re ready to deploy deep learning inference in production, binary size and memory footprint are key considerations – especially when deploying at the edge. OpenVINO provides a lightweight Inference Engine with a binary size of just over 40MB for CPU-based inference. It also provides a Model Server for serving models at scale and managing deployments.\nOpenVINO includes open-source developer tools to improve model inference performance. The first step is to convert a deep learning model (trained with TensorFlow, PyTorch,…) to an Intermediate Representation (IR) using the Model Optimizer. In fact, it cuts the model’s memory usage in half by converting it from FP32 to FP16 precision.\nOpen Model Zoo provides pre-trained models that work for real-world use cases to get you started quickly. Additionally, Python and C++ sample codes demonstrate how to interact with the model. More than 280 pre-trained models are available to download, from speech recognition to natural language processing and computer vision.\nFor this blog, we will use the pre-trained colorization models from Open Model Zoo and serve them with Model Server.\nDemo architecture “As a user, I can drag and drop my old black and white pictures to my browser so that it displays their ready-to-download colorized version.” – said the PM (me).\nFor that – replied the one-time software engineer (still me) – we only need:\nA fancy yet lightweight frontend component. OpenVINO™ Model Server to serve the neural network colorization predictions. A very light backend component. Whilst we could target the Model Server directly with the frontend (it exposes a REST API), we need to apply transformations to the submitted image. The colorization models, in fact, each expect a specific input.\nFinally, we’ll deploy these three services with Kubernetes because … well … because it’s groovy. And if you think otherwise (everyone is allowed to have a flaw or two), you’ll find a fully functional docker-compose.yaml in the source code repository.\nIn the upcoming sections, we will first look at each component and then show how to deploy them with Kubernetes using MicroK8s. Don’t worry; the full source code is freely available, and I’ll link you to the relevant parts.\ngRPC vs REST APIs The OpenVINO Model Server provides inference as a service endpoints for serving models in OpenVINO IR or ONNX format. It also offers centralized model management to serve multiple different models or different versions of the same model and model pipelines.\nThe server offers two sets of APIs to interface with it: REST and gRPC. Both APIs are compatible with TensorFlow Serving and expose endpoints for prediction, checking model metadata, and monitoring model status. For use cases where low latency and high throughput are needed, you’ll probably want to interact with the model server via the gRPC API. Indeed, it introduces a significantly smaller overhead than REST. (Read more about gRPC.)\nOpenVINO Model Server is distributed as a Docker image with minimal dependencies. For this demo, we will use the Model Server container image deployed to a MicroK8s cluster. This combination of lightweight technologies is suitable for small deployments such as a developer laptop or edge computing devices.\nNeural network – OpenVINO Model Server The colorization neural network is published under the BSD 2-clause License, accessible from the Open Model Zoo. It’s pre-trained, so we don’t need to understand it in order to use it. However, let’s look closer to understand what input it expects. I also strongly encourage you to read the original work from Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros. They made the approach super accessible and understandable on this website and in the original paper.\nAs you can see on the network architecture diagram, the neural network uses an unusual color space: LAB. In fact, there are many 3-dimensional spaces to code colors: RGB, HSL, HSV, etc. The LAB format is relevant here as it fully isolates the color information from the lightness information. Therefore, a grayscale image can be coded with only the L (for Lightness) axis. We will thereore only send the L axis to the neural network’s input. It will generate predictions for the colors coded on the two remaining axes: A and B.\nFrom the architecture diagram, we can also see that the model expects a 256×256 pixels input size. For these reasons, we cannot just send our RGB-coded grayscale picture in its original size to the network. We need to first transform it.\nWe compare the results of two different model versions for the demo. Let them be called ‘V1’ (Siggraph) and ‘V2’. The models are served with the same instance of the OpenVINO™ Model Server as two different models. (We could also have done it with two different versions of the same model – read more in the documentation.)\nFinally, to build the Docker image, we use the first stage from the Ubuntu-based development kit to download and convert the model. We then rebase on the more lightweight Model Server image.\n# Dockerfile: github.com/valentincanonical/colouriser-demo/blob/main/modelserver/Dockerfile FROM openvino/ubuntu20_dev:latest AS omz # download and convert the model … FROM openvino/model_server:latest # copy the model files and configure the Model Server … Backend – Ubuntu-based Flask app (Python) For the backend microservice that interfaces between the user-facing frontend and the Model Server hosting the neural network, we chose to use Python. There are many valuable libraries to manipulate data, including images, specifically for machine learning applications. To provide web serving capabilities, Flask is an easy choice.\nThe backend takes an HTTP POST request with the to-be-colorized picture. It synchronously returns the colorized result using the neural network predictions. In between – as we’ve just seen – it needs to convert the input to match the model architecture and to prepare the output to show a displayable result.\nHere’s what the transformation pipeline looks like on the input:\nAnd the output looks something like that:\nTo containerize our Python Flask application, we use the first stage with all the development dependencies to prepare our execution environment. We copy it onto a fresh Ubuntu base image to run it, configuring the model server’s gRPC connection.\nFrontend – Ubuntu-based NGINX container and Svelte app Finally, I put together a fancy UI for you to try the solution out. It’s an effortless single-page application with a file input field. It can display side-by-side the results from the two different colorization models.\nI used Svelte to build the demo as a dynamic frontend. Below each colorization result, there’s even a saturation slider (using a CSS transformation) so that you can emphasize the predicted colors and better compare the before and after.\nTo ship this frontend application, we again use a Docker image. We first build the application using the Node base image. We then rebase it on top of a preconfigured Ubuntu-based NGINX image. A reverse proxy on the frontend side serves as a passthrough to the backend on the /api endpoint to simplify the deployment configuration. We do that directly in an NGINX.conf configuration file copied to the NGINX templates directory. The container image is preconfigured to use these template files with environment variables.\nDeployment with Kubernetes I hope you had the time to digitalize some of your old black and white pictures because things are about to get serious(ly colorized).\nWe’ll assume you already have a running Kubernetes installation from the next section. If not, I encourage you to go through this MicroK8s tutorial.\nBuild the components’ Docker images Every component comes with a Dockerfile to build itself in a standard environment and ship its deployment dependencies (read What are containers for more information). They all create an Ubuntu-based Docker image for a consistent developer experience.\nBefore deploying our colorizer app with Kubernetes, we need to build and push the components’ images. They need to be hosted in a registry accessible from our Kubernetes cluster. We will use the built-in local registry with MicroK8s. Depending on your network bandwidth, building and pushing the images will take a few minutes or more.\ngit clone https://github.com/valentincanonical/colouriser-demo.git cd colouriser-demo # Backend docker build backend -t localhost:32000/backend:latest docker push localhost:32000/backend:latest # Model Server docker build modelserver -t localhost:32000/modelserver:latest docker push localhost:32000/modelserver:latest # Frontend docker build frontend -t localhost:32000/frontend:latest docker push localhost:32000/frontend:latest Apply the Kubernetes configuration files All the components are now ready for deployment. The Kubernetes configuration files are available as deployments and services YAML descriptors in the ./K8s folder of the demo repository. We can apply them all at once, in one command:\nkubectl apply -f ./k8s Give it a few minutes. You can watch the app being deployed with watch kubectl status. Of all the services, the frontend one has a specific NodePort configuration to make it publicly accessible by targeting the Node IP address.\nOnce ready, you can access the demo app at http://localhost:30000/ (or replace localhost with a cluster node IP address if you’re using a remote cluster). Pick an image from your computer, and get it colorized!\nThat’s a wrap! All in all, the project was pretty easy considering the task we accomplished. Thanks to Ubuntu containers, building each component’s image with multi-stage builds was a consistent and straightforward experience. And thanks to OpenVINO™ and the Open Model Zoo, serving a pre-trained model with excellent inference performance was a simple task accessible to all developers.\nCherry on top, you didn’t even have to share your pics over the Internet to get it done!\n","permalink":"https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/colorize-black-white-pictures/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you’re looking to bring a stack of old family photos back to life, check out Ubuntu’s demo on how to use OpenVINO on Ubuntu containers to colorize monochrome pictures.

Have you ever wondered what is the best word to play first? In this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ll explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve Wordle grids with a success rate of over 80%.\nI should clarify that I\u0026rsquo;m not a data scientist – while I have a passion for machine learning and have completed a few courses on the subject, I am not an AI expert. My understanding of the topic is limited, and I only decided to use CNNs for this experiment because that\u0026rsquo;s what I had learned in university. Please keep this in mind as you read through the post.\nWhat is the best word to play first in Wordle? As the game gained popularity a year ago, my partner and I found ourselves playing regularly. At some point, I noticed that we were both always starting our grids using the same first word every day. He was using \u0026ldquo;Reals\u0026rdquo; and I was using \u0026ldquo;Power\u0026rdquo;. To be fair I didn\u0026rsquo;t really think about it, just some kind of habit. But I realised he had better stats than me, maybe thanks to his choice.\nThere surely is a right, scientific answer to the question of what is the best word to play first in Wordle. One approach to finding this word could be to conduct a statistical analysis of the English language, considering factors such as the most common letters and their likelihood of appearing at certain positions in a 5-letter word. Boooooring.\nI remembered my Machine Learning classes and I thought that another, much more fun, way to go about it could be to teach a computer how to play Wordle, and observe. Maybe we could discover the secret to finding the best word to play first. There we go.\nProgramming Wordle for Machine Learning Computer programming is all about inputs and outputs (and one could argue that in an ideal world one would only use functional programming, but that will be another blog). What arguments do we pass to a function, and what results do we expect to see?\nFor our Wordle experiment, the output is clear: the daily Wordle word. But what about the input?\nModelising the game: mental model Note: There are many ways to approach this problem. My approach was influenced by my own experience playing the game and my understanding of CNNs. CNNs are particularly good at manipulating images, and my way to visualise the ongoing Wordle grid state in Wordle was a kind of image in my mind.\nOn The New York Times user interface, the input is a keyboard with some kind of state. It shows letters you can use, words you already tried, and for each letter if it was (1) not in the word, (2) in the word but wrongly placed, (3) in the word and rightfully placed. It also validates what words you’re allowed to play.\nTherefore, one way to represent this game state is as a matrix, with each position and letter representing the information we\u0026rsquo;ve learned about the word to be found. The matrix would have a 5x26 shape, on one axis the letter position (0-4) and on another axis the letter \u0026ldquo;code\u0026rdquo; (0-25). The value would tell us if the letter is (-2) not here for sure, (0) maybe here or nowhere, (1) somewhere in the word, or (2) here for sure.\nThis matrix is what I will adress as the \u0026ldquo;game state\u0026rdquo; in the following sections.\nFor each word we try, we can update the game state with the obtained information:\nGREEN: This letter is here (2), therefore no other letter can be here (-2). YELLOW: This letter might is somewhere (1), but we know for sure it’s not here (-2). NONE: This letter is nowhere in the word (-2). Using this mental model, we can code the logic of the game in Python. The \u0026ldquo;Wordle helper functions\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dataset generation\u0026rdquo; in the accompanying notebook contain all the necessary source code and steps for training a computer to play Wordle.\nNow that we have a way to represent the game state and a plan for programming the logic of the game, we can move on to building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve Wordle grids.\nConvolutional Neural Networks: The Wordle Whisperers A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network specifically designed for image recognition tasks. It is made up of layers of interconnected nodes, where each node represents a unit of computation. CNN classifiers, which is what we are going to build here, take a matrice of pixels as their input (the image), have multiple hidden computation layers, and their output layer is a 1D-array of the possible classes.\nIn the context of our Wordle experiment, we can think of each game state as an image, with the position and letter representing different pixels. By training a CNN on a large dataset of game states and their corresponding correct words, we can teach the model to recognize patterns in the game states and make predictions about the correct word to play.\nCNNs are particularly useful for our Wordle task as they are able to capture spatial relationships between pixels in an image. They not only consider one pixel but also its surroundings. In our case, not only one letter and its probabilities to be at this position, but also the surrounding letters and probabilities. This means that CNNs can learn to recognize patterns and features within the game states that might not be immediately apparent to a human observer.\nGenerating the dataset Before we can train our CNN to solve Wordle games, we need to have a dataset of possible game states and their corresponding correct words. In order to generate this dataset, we can use a simple player algorithm that iteratively plays random words from a dictionary, regardless of the game state. By saving the game state and the correct word for each iteration, we can build a large dataset of game states and their corresponding correct words.\nTo generate our dataset, we used a Wordle word list published on GitHub. This list contains 14855 words, therefore a random player has a 1/14855 probability of guessing the correct word on each turn. Given that the player can\u0026rsquo;t reuse a word, the probability of guessing the correct word on each subsequent turn decreases even further. But it\u0026rsquo;s so low anyway that we can consider it a binomial distribution (X∼Bin(n,p)) with a success probability of about 0.0001.\nUsing the cumulative binomial probabilities, we find that a random player has a chance of success (P(X\u0026gt;=1, n=6)) of about 0.06%. One game out of 1,600. By playing a large number of games, we can generate a dataset with a good balance of correct and incorrect guesses.\nIn order to generate a human-quality dataset, we only saved a progressed game state and the correct word for each game (LOOP_TRAINING, MATURE_TRAINING). This is because the initial random game state contains no information (only zeros) and would introduce only noise into our dataset.\nWe iterated on over 3.7 million random games, resulting in about 370,000 correct guesses.\nGenerating this random training data can take a significant amount of time. In the linked Google Colab notebook, I have saved the output of the cells so that you can look at the code without having to run the dataset generation yourself (took me about 25mn to generate all the data).\nCrafting the model Now that we have our dataset, it\u0026rsquo;s time to build the CNN model that will be used to solve Wordle games. In order to do this, we need to consider the shape of our input data (the game state) and the shape of our desired output (the correct word).\nThe input to our model is a matrix with 5 rows (corresponding to the 5 letters in the Wordle game) and 26 columns (corresponding to the 26 letters in the alphabet). The output of our model is a vector with 14855 elements, representing the \u0026ldquo;probabilities\u0026rdquo; of each word in our dictionary being the correct answer.\nOur CNN model will have the following architecture:\nThe CNN architecture for solving Wordle consists of a simple 5x26 game input state as the first layer, followed by a 2D convolution layer which allows neighboring elements to influence each other. This helps the CNN to learn what game states \u0026ldquo;look like\u0026rdquo; a word or another one, similar to how humans can recognize whether a sequence of letters looks like a probable English word. The output of the convolution layer is then flattened and passed through dense layers to reduce its size and extract relevant information for classification. Finally, the model diverges to a 14855-element array representing the possible words.\nTraining and evaluating the model Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve crafted our CNN model, it\u0026rsquo;s time to train it using the previously generated dataset. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Google Colab for this process and iterate over 15 epochs.\nWhile and after training the model, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to be able to measure how well it performs in the real Wordle. To evaluate the performance of our model, we will use two metrics:\nAccuracy: This is a common metric for evaluating machine learning models. It represents the rate of correct output guesses given a test input. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the accuracy of our model does not necessarily reflect its success at playing Wordle. This is because the input states used to calculate accuracy are already progressed (i.e., they are not completely random like when you start a Wordle game).\nWinning rate: To get a more accurate picture of our model\u0026rsquo;s performance, we will also calculate the \u0026ldquo;winning rate\u0026rdquo; of our model. To do this, we will simulate a large number of Wordle games (using a 6-try, cumulative game state feedback loop) and compute the rate of won games over the total number of played games.\nFor comparison, a completely random player has a winning rate of about 0.06% (calculated using cumulative binomial probabilities, P(X≥1, n=6)). For a more challenging and exciting benchmark, according to the New York Times, my personal winning rate is 96%.\nWordle Victory: CNNs Conquer the Game I put our CNN model to the test and the results were not quite bad! After just 15 minutes of training on a GPU runtime, the model was ready to take on the Wordle. Here\u0026rsquo;s what happened:\nGenerating the necessary data for training and testing took me 25 minutes The actual training process took just 15 minutes, with 15 epochs on a GPU! Model\u0026rsquo;s accuracy was a shy 79% – not so bad for a quick machine learning model! I put the model to the ultimate test by having it play 1000 random Wordle games. The winning rate? A pretty good 82% with just over 4 tries on average. While it may not be able to beat human players just yet, our CNN model is definitely on the right track!\nSo, What is The Best First Word to Play in Wordle? One question remains: what is the best first word to play in Wordle?\nThe first word played by our model is \u0026ldquo;Rales\u0026rdquo;. It appears to be accepted by Wordle, and to be an anagram of \u0026ldquo;Reals\u0026rdquo;, which was a favorite first move of my partner and seemed to yield higher winning rates. Could it be that the key to Wordle success lies in the word \u0026ldquo;Rales\u0026rdquo;? Our CNN model seems to think so.\nBONUS: Quordle? In the last cell of the Colab notebook, I have demoed using the trained CNN to play the Quordle variant of the Wordle game. As if playing Wordle wasn\u0026rsquo;t challenging enough, in Quordle, players must juggle four Wordle games at once.\nOne of the main limitations of CNNs is their inability to consider tradeoffs such as \u0026ldquo;explore vs exploit\u0026rdquo; when making decisions. In games like Wordle and Quordle, players often have to weigh the benefits of exploring their options (e.g. playing a word that may not be the correct one but provides more information) against the potential rewards of exploiting their current knowledge (e.g. playing a word that they believe is the correct one).\nThere is a cool article on this topic, using reinforcement learning to play Wordle.\nConclusion This experiment demonstrated the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for solving Wordle grids and potentially even surpassing human players. By training a CNN model on a dataset of random Wordle games, I was able to achieve a success rate of 82% when tested on 1000 games.\nI hope that this blog post has provided an entertaining and informative look at the world of Wordle and machine learning.
