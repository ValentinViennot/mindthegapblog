      <title>Principle of equitable empowerment</title>

      <description>Knowledge must be freely accessible to all, providing the foundation for informed autonomy and enabling the collective intelligence necessary to address systemic issues. Communities must have the freedom to self-organise, and societal structures should facilitate serendipitous innovation and resilience, ensuring that every individual has the same opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the collective effort to solve our biggest problems. Societal structures should be here to empower, not disable.</description>

      <title>Common tragedies: Funding open source vs Saving the planet</title>

      <description>In my last post —Why Open Source isn&amp;rsquo;t Profitable—, I explain the Curse of Competition as a sort of Tragedy of the Commons: because open-source intellectual property is free to access, all economic agents will exploit it without giving back (a.k.a. as the free riders issue). If the resource is finite, then its value will tragically be destroyed by this unrestrained consumption.
With the same analysis, we can explain how and why our current dominant economic system will eventually consume all of the available natural resources and destroy all living species.</description>

      <description>In a Capitalist economy, Open Source has no (direct) value.
Open source is not profitable Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a few definitions:
the price is the exchange value of a good or a service in a socio-economic context, the production cost is what it costs to build a good or deliver a service, added value is the price minus the production cost. Open-source software delivers an added value close to or below zero.</description>

      <description>Leaving this here for posterity:
&amp;ldquo;Dying isn&amp;rsquo;t as sad as Not living.&amp;rdquo;
—Valentin Viennot, 2023
I know; death is a sad and probably not the most exciting topic for a post. But you needed to read it. In fact, this post is more about life than death. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a wake-up call, an invitation even.
I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer that our life choices are investments that shape the value and meaning we extract from life itself.</description>

      <title>All we do is invest.</title>

      <description>All we are doing is investment. Taking the bus to meet a friend? That&amp;rsquo;s an investment. Quitting your job to work at another company? That&amp;rsquo;s investing. Skipping the gym? Bad investment, but still one. Going to bed early? Probably a good investment. So let me give you my best investment advice: spend your time wisely. Imagine you are a millionaire and you are placing your entire fortune into 24 chunks of money every day.</description>

      <title>The Open Market series.</title>

      <description>Welcome to the maze of ideas that&amp;rsquo;s been occupying my mind, only now finding their way to the surface, and to you. I believe that Open Source is now facing an existential crisis and requires a sustainable funding model, and that a decentralized crypto market can provide that solution.
This upcoming series of posts truly fits with the vision of the Mind the gap blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about a topic close to my heart —Open Source funding—, and directly contributing to my own mission: enhancing individual and collective human intelligence.</description>

      <description>If you’re looking to bring a stack of old family photos back to life, check out Ubuntu’s demo on how to use OpenVINO on Ubuntu containers to colorize monochrome pictures. This magical use of containers, neural networks, and Kubernetes is packed with helpful resources and a fun way to dive into deep learning!
A version of Part 1 and Part 2 of this article was first published on Ubuntu’s blog.</description>

      <description>Are you a fan of Wordle, the addictive word puzzle game? Have you ever wondered what is the best word to play first? In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve Wordle grids with a success rate of over 80%.
I should clarify that I&amp;rsquo;m not a data scientist – while I have a passion for machine learning and have completed a few courses on the subject, I am not an AI expert.</description>
